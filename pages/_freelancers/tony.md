# Features

## Customizable theme

The theme can be customized just by changing few variables in **\_config.yml** file.

## Inline CSS

Since the style used in this theme is very less, I'm inlining it. This will save a request and hence speeds up website loading.

## Light-weight

Since the theme is based on default Jekyll theme, it is very light-weight. No JavaScript except analytics is used!
