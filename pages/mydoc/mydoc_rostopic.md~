ROS GUI is designed as a plugin architecture which allows users to quickly implement Qt-based GUI's plugins with ROS, in particular for state information.

rqt_console/logger provides graphical interface to capture and broadcast log messages for filtering. _bag is designed to view ros bag contents such as images and visualized outputs (via rqt_plot). _web is integrated work space for ROS GUI.

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.

`choosing-a-ground-station:`

This page gives a high-level overview of the available Ground Control
Stations (GCS) and provides links so you can make the appropriate
choice.

### Overview


A ground station is typically a software application, running on a
ground-based computer, that communicates with your UAV via [wirelessTelemetry](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-telemetry-landingpage.html#common-telemetry-landingpage) :ref:`wireless telemetry <common-telemetry-landingpage>`. It displays real-time data
on the UAVs performance and position and can serve as a “virtual
cockpit”, showing many of the same instruments that you would have if
you were flying a real plane. A GCS can also be used to control a UAV in
flight, uploading new mission commands and setting parameters. It is
often also used to monitor the live video streams from a UAV’s cameras.

There are at least ten different ground control stations. On desktop there is (*Mission
Planner*, *APM Planner 2*, *MAVProxy*, *QGroundControl* and *UgCS*. For Tablet/Smartphone there is
*Tower* (DroidPlanner 3), *MAVPilot*, *AndroPilot* and *SidePilot* that can be
used to communicate with ArduPilot (i.e.
:ref:`Copter <copter:home>`,
`Plane <https://ardupilot.org/plane/index.html>`_,
:ref:`Rover <rover:home>`,
:ref:`AntennaTracker <antennatracker:home>`).

The decision to select a particular GCS often depends on your vehicle
and preferred computing platform:

-  **Ready-to-fly** users may prefer the portability and ease of use of
   *Tower* (Droid Planner 3), or another GCS running on a tablet or
   phone.
-  **DIY/Kit** users and developers often have to access configuration
   and analysis tools, and would therefore need (at least initially)
   *Mission Planner*, *APM Planner 2* or another more full-featured GCS.

.. note::
```
   This wiki primarily refers to set-up and configuration using the
   Mission Planner, because it was created first and is the most
   full-featured GCS.
```

### Additional GCS hardware


#### Android
---------------

For Android devices, you will need:

-  Android based tablet that can act as a USB host. Google Nexus tablets
   are recommended, and the compatible hardware lists for the different
   GCSs are listed in the table above.
-  :ref:`SiK Telemetry Radio System <common-sik-telemetry-radio>` or
   similar (915 Mhz for US, 433 for Europe) which includes the
   bidirectional ground and air telemetry units.
-  USB OTG cable (typically less than $2 on
   `ebay <http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=m570.l3201&_nkw=usb+otg+cable&_sacat=0>`__
   and
   `Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/T-Flash-Adapter-Samsung-GT-i9100-GT-N7000/dp/B005FUNYSA/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1376262351&sr=8-5&keywords=android+otg+cable>`__).

   
#### iOS
---------------

For iOS devices, you will need:

-  iOS Based device such as an iPad or iPhone. If running iPad, the cellular version is recommended for better GPS support.
-  Wifi or Bluetooth LE link to the Drone
-  Bridge Connection to a:ref:`SiK Telemetry Radio System <common-sik-telemetry-radio>` via Wifi or Bluetooth LE

  See iOS App Vendors for more details.

### Desktop PCs (Windows/Mac/Linux)


For Desktop devices you will need:

-  :ref:`SiK Telemetry Radio System <common-sik-telemetry-radio>` or
   :ref:`similar <common-telemetry-landingpage>` (915 Mhz for US, 433 for
   Europe) which includes the bidirectional ground and air telemetry
   units.

As shown in the figure above, the 1st–5th input ports are five input channels from the RC transmitter (“ch1”–“ch5”); the 6th–8th input ports are the angular velocity (“p”, “q”, “r”) from the gyroscope sensor; the 9th–10th input ports are the roll angle and pitch angles (“phi”, “theta”) estimated from the inertial sensor. As shown in Fig. 3.8, the computing process of the entire “Controller” subsystem is roughly divided into five steps.

(1). The “Input Interfaces” module receives the RC transmitter signals and the multicopter state estimation signals. [1]

(2). The “RC Signal Process” module maps the five-channel signals of the RC transmitter to the desired roll and pitch angle values.

(3). The “Attitude Controller” module computes the desired force and torque values to control the multicopter to the desired attitude.

(4). The “Motor Control Signal Computation” module maps the force and torque values to the control signals (ranging from 1000 to 2000) for the four motors.

(5). The “Output Interfaces” module fills the remaining 4-dimensional control signals and generates an 8-dimensional PWM signal (there are eight PWM output ports on Pixhawk) ranging from 1000 to 2000µs. [2]
