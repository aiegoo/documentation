      Even as a child, plain, boyish Annie Revels had everyone's role in life figured out. Everyone's, that is, except her own. Her mother was sickly and needed to be taken care of. Her little sister Rebecca was remarkably beautiful, where Annie was not. Her father was a waterman, a free-looking life Annie deeply envied and could've had, if only she'd been born a son.

     For me to really like a book, it's got to feel real: dialogue needs to sound authentic, characters need to well developed &amp; a mix of good &amp; bad, as real people are. Likewise, I don't want the ending to be predictable, nor all happy or all tragic. I also prefer fairly clean language &amp; no graphic sex scenes. (Not because I think those have no place in literature, but just for my own mental health.)

     Blurbed by the likes of Stephen King for its exceptional creepiness, "The Little Stranger" will disappoint those who are looking for a page turner in the mold of the American master of Gothic horror. Yes, the novel has all the trappings of a standard haunted house thriller: a once-grand, remotely situated mansion; owners reduced to shabby gentility; things that inexplicably go bump in the night; violent disfigurements and mysterious deaths. But all this is only scaffolding for a meticulously thoughtful.

     The experiences of the author's mother inspired this debut novel, a somewhat improbable tale of star-crossed love in 1928 China. Valentina Ivanova and her 16-year-old daughter, Lydia, White Russian refugees, live in grinding poverty in the International Settlement of Junchow, subsisting off whatever presents Valentina can charm from gentlemen admirers and the profits Lydia makes from pawning stolen goods. When Lydia inadvertently attracts the unwelcome attentions of a criminal gang, the Black Snakes, she finds a rescuer in Chang An Lo, an English-speaking Communist and kung fu master.
