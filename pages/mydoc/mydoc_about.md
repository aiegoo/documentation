This is my first web page I have created, without any css, html or jquery snippets being used. It's been pride of my savvy impromptu skills of survival. 4 years ago.

- my wordpress theme customization
  - now dyfunct tonyleekorea.com has been in service for the last 2 years, with my portfolio and profile including cvs being kept with it.
  - cariana.tonyleekorea.com was a very simple shopping web app with no cart, no payment options. 
  - then I have created more extensive shopping cart from cafe24 almost 4 years ago, which is still in service, with all the frills and jingles of shopping mall site would need. [yogaman](https://yogaman.club)
