Sky-Drones provides avionics hardware and software solutions for drone manufacturers and drone service providers globally.
The Sky-Drones Platform helps to integrate drones in custom end-to-end workflows with an abundance of advanced features that are essential to enterprise customers including:
Real-time digital HD video streaming;
Real-time payload data processing (e.g. computer vision);
Real-time flight control (e.g. target tracking, collision prevention and obstacle avoidance);
In-flight telemetry and payload data streaming directly to customer’s cloud;
Drone-to-drone communications;
Running custom apps directly on the drone (edge computing);
Safely performing autonomous BVLOS missions with real-time control.
Sky-Drones Platform Structure
Software
​ powered by .
​ - super easy and intuitive 3D mission planning and remote flight control applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android + web application in the .
​:
3D mission planning & control web application;
Drone fleet management, performance monitoring, post-flight AI-analytics;
Integration services, the “glue” that connects drones, apps, partners and customers' software (see how  was designed for customers).
Tightly integrated partner software such as UTM services, fleet management solutions, flight logs, etc.

Sky-Drones offer two major purchasing options:
Purchasing hardware from Sky-Drones website or via international dealers;
On-site production.
Purchasing Hardware from Sky-Drones
We appreciate the different integration levels required by the drone manufacturers. Therefore we offer two slightly different editions of AIRLink - the most advanced drone avionics: Enterprise and Core. AIRLink Enterprise is ideal for a quick start, evaluation and prototyping while Core is optimised for deep integration and mid-high volume manufacturing.
Parameter
AIRLink Enterprise
AIRLink Core
Enclosure
Aluminum, with integrated heatsink and fan mounting option.
External heatsink or reasonable power dissipation should be provided by the design.
Dimensions
L103 x W61 x H37 mm
L100 x W57 x H22 mm
Weight
198 g
89 g
Operating temperature
-40°C-..+50°C
-40°C-..+50°C
Production volume
Low to Medium
Medium to High
SmartAP AIRLink Core edition is intended for medium to high volume production and deep integration with customer's hardware. The weight of electronics is only 80g and can be tightly integrated in the airframe design. However, heat dissipation requirements (provided by Sky-Drones) should be met for proper system operation.
On-site production
Licensed Production
The Sky-Drones team helps setting up the production on-site and performs turnkey production commissioning. Manufacturing technology is not disclosed. This option allows customer to optimize the logistics and produce the system locally.
Reference Design
The Sky-Drones team installs all the equipment on-site and performs turnkey production commissioning as well as transferring production technology.
This option is intended for:
Drone manufacturers;
High-volume production;
Excessively tight integrations.
You can:
Manufacture at your own factory;
Control the volume;
Modify schematics and layout to suit your needs.
You receive:
Schematics / layout / CAD / BOM;
Engineering support from the Sky-Drones team.
This option would suit well to large volume orders, e.g. UAV fleets. Interested? ​
Hardware customizations
In any of the above cases, the Sky-Drones team would be glad to slightly or deeply customize hardware to fit the customer's requirements.
