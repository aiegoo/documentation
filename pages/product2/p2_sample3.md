​ Air is based on a powerful quad-core ARM Cortex A53 SoC (system-on-chip) computer running Linux. The system is capable of handling two real time HD video streams from cameras (CSI and HDMI), autopilot telemetry and control. It has an abundant supply of resources for user applications with various interfaces including USB, UART, I2C, and SPI allowing users to connect their desired payloads and tightly integrate it with their flight controller and / or ground control station. LTE connection is also available and is operated by plug and play technology.

### Ground module

## Installation
### Preparing Air module
First of all, attach your antennas to the air module:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151635938-b2deea2e-55a4-480b-925c-467a1559aeef.png)

WARNING: DO NOT power up any of the modules without antennas! Powering up the modules without antennas may cause malfunction of the amplifier and permanent damage. Powering up without antennas voids warranty.
Then attach the power supply cable and autopilot telemetry cables:
Power supply goes to 5V DC connector
Autopilot telemetry cable goes to UART connector
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151635965-bf69d259-280d-4b56-8097-db1c0abf1723.png)

What the air module should look like with power and telemetry cables connected:
Red cable in the autopilot telemetry cable is 5V power supply from SmartLink to Autopilot. If your autopilot is powered from its own power supply then remove the red cable. In this case you should only used black (GND) and yellow / green (Data TX / RX). By default, the whole cable is supplied without the red cable.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151635982-94013e37-5afd-4703-a370-6785e3e3df17.png)

Connect CSI camera to camera socket. Use a small sharp tool to unlock the crimp:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636011-505d234d-e49c-46aa-9456-92a59892478b.png)

Put the FPC camera cable in and lock the crimp by pushing it. At this stage the setup should look as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636558-52766873-a63d-48c6-8568-2df796eddf05.png)

Connect HDMI camera if desired:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636520-5d1f2ef5-2dd4-4bb3-8a51-c57be9c3b016.png)

The setup should look as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636509-574bb8b2-2644-4968-90f8-221a4658e3b6.png)

In this example we demonstrate with a GoPro Hero 6 video camera with 1080p@60fps video output. SmartLink is capable of capturing the following video source types:
1080p@60fps
1080p@30fps
720p@60fps
720p@30fps

### Preparing Ground module
Attach antennas to the ground module:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636491-9c636817-0dd7-41d8-aa93-35f5f5236f9a.png)

By default, 5 dBi antennas come included in the set. Depending on your specific applications you might choose to use alternative antennas designed for 2.4 GHz band.
Connect your micro USB cable and power cable to the ground module as shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636481-53954509-d209-4b85-834d-7defb6eb392b.png)

If you would like to use custom antennas, please contact us here

### Power supply
Ground module supports any power supply source with a voltage ranging from 10V to 50V. We recommend to use 3S or 4S LiPo battery to power the ground module. The typical current for 3S battery power is around 1A at maximum power output.
Air module is 5V tolerant only. Peak current can be up to 3A, therefore make sure to provide a powerful, stable and reliable power supply to the air module. We highly recommend to use SmartAP PDB 5V output port to power SmartLink. SmartAP PDB has 5V at 5A max power output which powers SmartLink perfectly.
DANGER: AIR MODULE IS 5V-ONLY TOLERANT. POWERING THE MODULE WITH HIGHER VOLTAGE MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE SYSTEM. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO POWER FROM SMARTAP PDB 5V OUTPUT
Please note that warranty is void if air module is powered with a source above 5V.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636467-8c1f63b4-9193-4056-adba-a16248f36e61.png)

Connect two power leads to SmartAP PDB 5V output. SmartAP PDB can be powered from 3S-12S LiPo battery. We power it from laboratory power supply for this demonstration (15V).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636437-51921837-13b3-4d03-aee9-76a02ceda352.png)

### Autopilot
SmartLink system is compatible with any autopilot which has TTL UART telemetry port. For instance, it's compatible with:
SmartAP Autopilot
Pixhawk series Autopilot
APM series Autopilot
other TTL UART telemetry port autopilots
For this demonstration we use [SmartAP MAX](https://sky-drones.com/smartap-max) Autopilot from Sky-Drones:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636361-25e2794f-3fa9-4e4e-9821-1cb1b0e2172a.png)

Connect telemetry cable to Radio port of the autopilot as shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636348-2dd89cbf-91d0-4a96-93d4-b2e443aff23f.png)

After completing the steps above you will have fully assembled air module. Before the first power up, make sure you have assembled air module and ground module as shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636321-029d1d42-56f4-433d-a279-649037a255a0.png)

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

### Initial power up
Power up both ground module and air module.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636306-7fe89d61-b03b-488b-b023-1a71e17cc05c.png)

It might take up to 15 seconds for both modules to properly boot up and link to each other. By default, modules come pre-configured and paired. Transmission power is set to minimum.
Ground module has status LEDs which allows it to identify the current status of the system. The most important LEDs are RSSI:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636301-df4966b4-6768-413e-ae0f-d56d7c3d7cea.png)

Three RSSI LEDs blinking altogether: RF off
Three RSSI LEDs blinking in turn: Searching for pair
One, two or three LEDs solid: RSSI status, more solid LEDs equals better signal
The expected LEDs pattern is as shown below - blinking in turn and then all three LEDs solid:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636236-bfd50a66-2f64-4ed2-abcf-0fc7c742e6a4.png)

### Software
#### Verify SmartLink was discovered
{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}} Normally you don't need to run the steps in this section since SmartLink should be recognized automatically. But the steps in this section might be useful for establishing connection if this has not happened automatically.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
First of all, check if SmartLink ground module has been recognized properly by your computer. You should be able to see it as Ethernet device. For instance, go to the command line and type ifconfig  for MacOS / Linux or ipconfig  for Windows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636212-fd2e7f16-bbca-4add-813a-f7318f1b2202.png)

You should see that one of the network adapters has an IP address in the range of 192.168.168.xxx. This means that SmartLink has been successfully discovered by your computer. Alternatively, you can check the configuration with Network Manager and / or assign a static IP address:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636194-99e621f8-4d30-4399-bc94-7eb44da79d22.png)

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Make sure you have configured your WiFi internet connection with the priority higher than the priority of SmartLink ethernet connection. Otherwise, your computer will loose internet connection while SmartLink ground module is connected. {{site.data.alerts.end}}
Another method to check that SmartLink is properly recognized by your computer is to ping it. Open the command line and type  ping smartlink.local. If you are able to see the proper response in the command line then it means SmartLink has been discovered by your computer.
SmartLink is configured with static IP address 192.168.168.100. For instance, if you're running SmartLink with Android which doesn't support Local DNS - please use static IP address for connecting.
In case you're unable to ping `smartlink.local` it might be a DNS problem. In other words, the operating system can't find the IP address' corresponding name. This might happen on some Windows platforms and is applied to all Android based platforms. Follow these steps to resolve it: Use IP addressing instead of DNS

### Run Ground Station Software
Once you have everything connected and powered up you may start the ground station software. SmartLink is compatible with various popular ground control stations. In this demonstration we use SmartAP GCS by Sky-Drones. SmartLink is fully supported by SmartAP GCS. Start SmartAP GCS and go to Settings in left hand side menu:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636168-332468c4-5faf-47a9-844e-f24335a4d0e7.png)

Enable the option Autoconnect to SmartLinkas this will enable SmartLink to automatically connect.
After that, go back to the World pane and click the Connections button in the top right hand corner. You will see SmartLink connection added. If it's not added automatically, or it is missing completely, you may add it manually as shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636149-45fedfa0-35a2-4043-8d7a-0970d9300c4f.png)

Upon clicking Open connection will be established and you should be able to see telemetry information at this step.
To set up the video click on the Settings button of the one of the video widgets and select the desired source. For this demonstration we need to select SmartLink Video 1 option:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636132-3c5c80b3-6173-49e6-a7d8-b3b42cfc2e54.png)

After 1-2 seconds the video feed will appear and connection status will be set to OK:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636109-9aac74c9-b494-4e4c-9427-a2dd4b4b8fc8.png)

You can easily switch between full map and full video simply by tapping on the video feed you'd like to see in full screen:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636096-240b9aab-c053-4dd8-96ba-7e94e6854403.png)

Finally, the full setup looks as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636081-b0691814-683c-483b-aded-ecfeba585bdc.png)

## Manual Control
SmartLink allows users to transmit a manual control signal from any USB device (e.g. joystick, gamepad or RC radio with USB port) along with other messages when connected to ground control station.
In this demonstration we demonstrate how to setup manual control using FrSky Taranis radio in USB joystick mode. First of all, open  and go to Settings.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636691-a7c76180-e0aa-4ade-a2e7-402d277593a9.png)

Then switch to the Joystick tab. Make sure your joystick is connected and selected from the dropdown menu.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636822-0377692d-042d-40ea-a9a4-a79de6d357d3.png)

Once you've selected the joystick you will be able to assign the channels according to your preferences. Make sure that Enable pilot joystick for control is checked, otherwise manual control messages will not be sent.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636900-08028daf-c74e-4590-b87a-f712ea6cc1c6.png)

Additionally, you can connect a second joystick which will be used for payload control.
After that, if you go back to the World pane you will see a green joystick icon on toolbar. This means that the joystick has been configured successfully and is emitting a manual control signal.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636908-a11c5ca1-21ca-4936-a152-c842ba74ed76.png)


## Change Settings
### Accessing Settings Menu
SmartLink has various settings which you may change to optimize the performance. To get to 's settings menu click on the Wireless Connection icon on top toolbar:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636912-afdaddfc-965c-4b43-b012-7027d8fce1f1.png)

### Changing Radio settings
Radio tab allows you to change radio settings as well as observe current RSSI and SNR values for connection.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636936-6984d9e2-bb87-43da-aa2b-97148fad2bf1.png)

SNR - Signal Noise Ratio, the ratio of signal power to the noise power, expressed in decibels.
RSSI - Received Signal Strength Indication, a measure of the energy observed by an antenna when receiving a signal
It's recommended to keep output TX power for both air and ground module at low values when working with the system on the ground. 7 dBm is the minimum and recommended value. Use higher values when flying. Using high values over long periods of time near the human body might cause health problems due to radiation.
After changing any parameter click Save. It might take a few seconds to save changes applied. The system may loose connection when changing any parameter.

### Changing Security settings

Security tab allows you to assign network name and encryption key. Connection is AES encrypted.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151636967-e644fc9c-85a6-4654-8166-a6155db15511.png)

Make sure that both air and ground modules have the same network name and encryption key. Otherwise, the modules are not considered to be paired and won't connect to each other.

## API and SDK

## Firmware Update
Using Ubuntu:
Get USB Boot Utility (only needs to be done once)
First of all, you will need USB boot utility which will force the system transition into bootloader state.
Download the USBBoot tool here: ​
Force SmartLink Bootloader Mode
Once you have the boot tool, let's start it and flash the firmware.
Open command line and locate USBBoot
Start bootloader tool
sudo ./usbboot
Connect USB cable, turn on power supply (make sure to connect USB cable before providing power)
After a few seconds the terminal will show that bootloader mode has been successfully enabled. Then you can proceed to flashing or saving the image file
Flash SmartLink Image from File
Enable bootloader mode as described in the steps above
Use lsblk or df -h to find out the mounting point of the unit (look for 3.9GB unit since eMMC of SmartLink has this amount of flash memory)
Locate the firmware file
To flash image from file (make sure to set correct filename and sdX):
gunzip --stdout IMAGE_NAME.img.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdX status=progress
Upload process may take up to 15 minutes. Progress will be displayed on the screen.
 After upload process is complete, power off SmartLink before disconnecting the USB cable.
Save Current SmartLink as Image to File
You can save the entire eMMC of  to image file and later flash this to another  unit. Please follow these steps:
Enable bootloader mode as described in the steps above
Use lsblk or df -h to find out the mounting point of the unit (look for 3.9GB unit since eMMC of SmartLink has this amount of flash memory)
To save currently installed image to file (make sure to set correct sdX):
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdX status=progress | gzip > smartlink.img.gz
 After download process is complete, power off SmartLink before disconnecting the USB cable.
Using Windows / MacOS:
Get Boot Tool utility for forcing the bootloader
Please ensure you are not writing to any USB devices whilst the installer is running.
Download and run the  to install the drivers and boot tool.
Once the driver installation is complete, run the exe tool that was previously installed.
Plug micro USB cable into the micro USB socket marked USB on SmartLink.
Plug the other side of the USB cable in your computer.
Power up SmartLink. It's important to plug in the USB cable first and only then power up SmartLink.
After a few seconds, the SmartLink eMMC will pop up under Windows as a disk (USB mass storage device).
Get balenaEtcher for flashing the image
Download the Windows installer from ​
Run balenaEtcher and select the SmartLink OS image file
Select the correct storage drive (SmartLink)
Finally, click Burn to write the SmartLink OS image
You'll see a progress bar. Once complete, power down SmartLink first and only then unplug the USB cable.
Recovery procedure
If your  unit is not responding and you think eMMC might be corrupted / the device seems to be bricked, you will need to re-flash the image to eMMC. Please contact us  and we'll provide you with the link to the latest SmartLink image file.

## Troubleshooting
Unable to detect LAN network from ground module
In case you can't see that the LAN network from ground module was detected and established, then you would need to install the driver:
LAN Driver - Windows 8.1
LAN Driver - Windows 10
LAN Driver - Linux
LAN Driver - Mac OS
You can find the latest drivers from Realtek available .
In some cases you might need to disable ’system integrity protection’ and then instal the driver For instance,  is the demo video on how to disable SIP on Mac OS.

### Unable to Ping smartlink.local - Unknown Host
Some operating systems might not have local DNS, resulting in the inability to access the system using the name (smartlink.local). This is known for all Android platforms and some Windows platforms. In case you can't ping smartlink.local or similar:
ping: cannot resolve smartlink.local: Unknown host
You'll need to find out the IP address for SmartLink. There are numerous ways to do this, we'll use the NMAP tool in this example. First of all, download and install NMAP tool using the relevant links below:

### Linux
sudo apt-get install nmap

### Mac OS
brew install nmap

### Windows
Go to the official website for NMAP tool:
Select Latest stable release self-installer: nmap-7.80-setup.exe or similar. Download and install it.
Make sure to select Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible mode during the installation.
After installation is complete, open command line and go to NMAP folder:
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap"

### Looking up SmartLink's IP Address
Execute IP addresses scan within the required range, in our case it will be:
nmap 192.168.168.*
As a result of this command you'll see IP addresses in this range. You'll have 192.168.168.1 which is, as a rule, configured as air module, 192.168.168.2 which is usually configured as ground module and 192.168.168.x (x: 0-255) which is the IP address for SmartLink. You should use this IP address - 192.168.168.x for direct connection instead of smartlink.local.

### No Internet Connection when SmartLink is Plugged into USB Port
Sometimes you might not be connected to the internet after SmartLink is plugged into the USB port and detected. SmartLink is identified as LAN connection and sometimes the operating system expects this to be a primary connection for accessing the internet. It is in fact not. You still have to use your LAN / WLAN for internet access and this has to be set in the operating system.
Do the following actions to enable internet access while SmartLink is connected:

#### Windows
Follow the steps from this tutorial to change the MTU value for network connections:
​​
A lower MTU value means higher priority for the interface. Therefore, you need to have the MTU value set lower for your LAN / WLAN network than for SmartLink networks
#### Linux
Open command line and execute the following command:
sudo ip route del default
#### Mac OS
Go to network connections menu and make sure that the Service Order is set higher for your LAN / WLAN connection but not SmartLink:

## Installation hints

### Antenna Orientation
Orientation of the antennas is vital. Ground module has high gain 5 dBi antennas with a vertical plain radiation pattern is ~40 degrees. Therefore, antennas on the ground module should be placed vertically. If you want the system to be less reliant on antenna orientation then antennas should be changed to lower gain antennas (2-5 dBi). They will yield a lower range but will be less dependent on the orientation of antennas.
The image below demonstrates the relation between antenna gain, radiation pattern and range:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151637427-14d69332-4bff-4fce-a6fd-cc61e7f6c740.png)

For a solid connection the copter should stay in the blue area. In this example, the range is anywhere in the 2 dB antenna blue circle. 9 dB antenna has a reduced area but a longer range for certain directions. Same rules are applied to antennas on copters, whose antennas are 3 dBi by default and should be placed vertically down (cable from antenna facing up to the sky). Another thing to consider for longer range - ground module should be placed higher off the ground. At least one meter is required but there is a significant difference between 1 meter and 2 meters off the ground; the higher the better! 1.50 - 2.00 meters is recommended.
Frequencies
The system operates at 2.4 GHz, therefore, it's recommended to keep 2.4 GHz band free from other devices.
