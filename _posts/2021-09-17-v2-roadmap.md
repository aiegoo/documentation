## 2021-10-02 update
{% site.data.alerts.calloutprimary %}Today can be a landmark for version 2 as I was able to implement most of the items I have set out to accomplish."{% site.data.alerts.end %}
What's left to do;
- integrate vscode-journal into blogs --> this will mean to create a workspace that will add journal ledgers that will work within the blog folders.
- drone devworks would require time and outside helps but adding contents comprising of my inventories and arms stock would be a choice to follow up on.
