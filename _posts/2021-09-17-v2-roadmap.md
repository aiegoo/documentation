## 2021-10-02 update
{{site.data.alerts.callout_primary}}Today can be a landmark for version 2 as I was able to implement most of the items I have set out to accomplish.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
What's left to do;
- integrate vscode-journal into blogs --> this will mean to create a workspace that will add journal ledgers that will work within the blog folders.
- drone devworks would require time and outside helps but adding contents comprising of my inventories and arms stock would be a choice to follow up on.
- to adopt a new fontface such as 
  
  {{site.data.alerts.note}}
  <p><a href="https://noonnu.cc/font_page/445" title="ibm flex sans"></a>IBM Flex Sans</p>
  <pre>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'IBMPlexSansKR-ExtraLight';
    src: url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/projectnoonnu/noonfonts_20-07@1.0/IBMPlexSansKR-ExtraLight.woff') format('woff');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
    </pre>
    <p><a href="https://www.bytedude.com/jekyll-previous-and-next-posts/" title="IMB font">blog using this font</p></a>
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}
