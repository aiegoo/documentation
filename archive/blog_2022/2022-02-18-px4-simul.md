## Gazebo Simulation

[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) is a powerful 3D simulation environment for autonomous robots that is particularly suitable for testing object-avoidance and computer vision.
This page describes its use with SITL and a single vehicle.
Gazebo can also be used with [HITL](../simulation/hitl.md) and for [multi-vehicle simulation](../simulation/multi-vehicle-simulation.md).

**Supported Vehicles:** Quad ([Iris](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#copter_quadrotor_wide_3dr_iris_quadrotor) and [Solo](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#copter_quadrotor_x_3dr_solo), Hex (Typhoon H480), [Generic quad delta VTOL](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#vtol_standard_vtol_generic_quad_delta_vtol), Tailsitter, Plane, Rover, Submarine/UUV.

:::warning
Gazebo is often used with [ROS](../ros/README.md), a toolkit/offboard API for automating vehicle control.
If you plan to use PX4 with ROS you **should follow the** [ROS Instructions](../simulation/ros_interface.md) to install both ROS and Gazebo (and thereby avoid installation conflicts).

## Installation

Gazebo 9 setup is included in our standard build instructions:
- **macOS:** [Development Environment on Mac](../dev_setup/dev_env_mac.md)
- **Linux:** [Development Environment on Ubuntu LTS / Debian Linux > Gazebo, JMAVSim and NuttX (Pixhawk) Targets](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md#gazebo-jmavsim-and-nuttx-pixhawk-targets)
- **Windows:** Not supported.

Additional installation instructions can be found on [gazebosim.org](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b1).


## Running the Simulation

Run a simulation by starting PX4 SITL and gazebo with the airframe configuration to load (multicopters, planes, VTOL, optical flow and multi-vehicle simulations are supported).

The easiest way to do this is to open a terminal in the root directory of the PX4 *PX4-Autopilot* repository and call `make` for the desired target.
For example, to start a quadrotor simulation (the default):
```sh
cd /path/to/PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl gazebo
```

The supported vehicles and `make` commands are listed below (click links to see vehicle images).

:::note
For the full list of build targets run `make px4_sitl list_vmd_make_targets` (and filter on those that start with `gazebo_`).

:::note
The [Installing Files and Code](../dev_setup/dev_env.md) guide is a useful reference if there are build errors.
:::

The commands above launch a single vehicle with the full UI.
Other options include:
- [Starting PX4 and Gazebo separately](#start_px4_sim_separately) so that you can keep Gazebo running and only re-launch PX4 when needed (quicker than restarting both).
- Run the simulation in [Headless Mode](#headless), which does not start the Gazebo UI (this uses fewer resources and is much faster).

## Simulation

Simulators allow PX4 flight code to control a computer modeled vehicle in a simulated "world".
You can interact with this vehicle just as you might with a real vehicle, using *QGroundControl*, an offboard API, or a radio controller/gamepad.

> **Tip** Simulation is a quick, easy, and most importantly, *safe* way to test changes to PX4 code before attempting to fly in the real world.
  It is also a good way to start flying with PX4 when you haven't yet got a vehicle to experiment with.

PX4 supports both *Software In the Loop (SITL)* simulation, where the flight stack runs on computer (either the same computer or another computer on the same network) and *Hardware In the Loop (HITL)* simulation using a simulation firmware on a real flight controller board.

Information about available simulators and how to set them up are provided in the next section.
The other sections provide general information about how the simulator works, and are not required to *use* the simulators.

---
The remainder of this topic is a "somewhat generic" description of how the simulation infrastructure works.
It is not required to *use* the simulators.


### Simulator MAVLink API

All simulators communicate with PX4 using the Simulator MAVLink API.
This API defines a set of MAVLink messages that supply sensor data from the simulated world to PX4 and return motor and actuator values from the flight code that will be applied to the simulated vehicle.
The image below shows the message flow.

![Simulator MAVLink API](../../assets/simulation/px4_simulator_messages.png)

> **Note** A SITL build of PX4 uses [simulator_mavlink.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/src/modules/simulator/simulator_mavlink.cpp) to handle these messages while a hardware build in HIL mode uses [mavlink_receiver.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cpp).
  Sensor data from the simulator is written to PX4 uORB topics.
  All motors / actuators are blocked, but internal software is fully operational.

The messages are described below (see links for specific detail).

Message | Direction | Description
--- | --- | ---
[MAV_MODE:MAV_MODE_FLAG_HIL_ENABLED](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_MODE_FLAG_HIL_ENABLED) | NA | Mode flag when using simulation. All motors/actuators are blocked, but internal software is fully operational.
[HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS) | PX4 to Sim | PX4 control outputs (to motors, actuators).
[HIL_SENSOR](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_SENSOR) | Sim to PX4 | Simulated IMU readings in SI units in NED body frame.
[HIL_GPS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_GPS) | Sim to PX4 | The simulated GPS RAW sensor value.
[HIL_OPTICAL_FLOW](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_OPTICAL_FLOW) | Sim to PX4 | Simulated optical flow from a flow sensor (e.g. PX4FLOW or optical mouse sensor)
[HIL_STATE_QUATERNION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_STATE_QUATERNION) | Sim to PX4 | Contains the actual "simulated" vehicle position, attitude, speed etc. This can be logged and compared to PX4's estimates for analysis and debugging (for example, checking how well an estimator works for noisy (simulated) sensor inputs).
[HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_RC_INPUTS_RAW) | Sim to PX4 | The RAW values of the RC channels received.


### Default PX4 MAVLink UDP Ports

By default, PX4 uses commonly established UDP ports for MAVLink communication with ground control stations (e.g. *QGroundControl*), Offboard APIs (e.g. MAVSDK, MAVROS) and simulator APIs (e.g. Gazebo).
These ports are:

* UDP Port **14540** is used for communication with offboard APIs.
  Offboard APIs are expected to listen for connections on this port.
* UDP Port **14550** is used for communication with ground control stations.
  GCS are expected to listen for connections on this port.
  *QGroundControl* listens to this port by default.
* The simulator's local TCP Port **4560** is used for communication with PX4.
  PX4 listens to this port, and simulators are expected to initiate the communication by broadcasting data to this port.

> **Note** The ports for the GCS and offboard APIs are set in configuration files, while the simulator broadcast port is hard-coded in the simulation MAVLink module.


### SITL Simulation Environment

The diagram below shows a typical SITL simulation environment for any of the supported simulators.
The different parts of the system connect via UDP, and can be run on either the same computer or another computer on the same network.

* PX4 uses a simulation-specific module to connect to the simulator's local TCP port 4560.
  Simulators then exchange information with PX4 using the [Simulator MAVLink API](#simulator-mavlink-api) described above.
  PX4 on SITL and the simulator can run on either the same computer or different computers on the same network.
* PX4 uses the normal MAVLink module to connect to ground stations (which listen on port 14550) and external developer APIs like MAVSDK or ROS (which listen on port 14540).
* A serial connection is used to connect Joystick/Gamepad hardware via *QGroundControl*.

![PX4 SITL overview](../../assets/simulation/px4_sitl_overview.png)

If you use the normal build system SITL `make` configuration targets (see next section) then both SITL and the Simulator will be launched on the same computer and the ports above will automatically be configured.
You can configure additional MAVLink UDP connections and otherwise modify the simulation environment in the build configuration and initialisation files.


#### Starting/Building SITL Simulation

The build system makes it very easy to build and start PX4 on SITL, launch a simulator, and connect them.
The syntax (simplified) looks like this:
```
make px4_sitl simulator[_vehicle-model]
```
where `simulator` is `gazebo`, `jmavsim` or some other simulator, and vehicle-model is a particular vehicle type supported by that simulator ([jMAVSim](../simulation/jmavsim.md) only supports multicopters, while [Gazebo](../simulation/gazebo.md) supports many different types).

A number of examples are shown below, and there are many more in the individual pages for each of the simulators:

```sh
# Start Gazebo with plane
make px4_sitl gazebo_plane

# Start Gazebo with iris and optical flow
make px4_sitl gazebo_iris_opt_flow

# Start JMavSim with iris (default vehicle model)
make px4_sitl jmavsim
```

The simulation can be further configured via environment variables:
- `PX4_ESTIMATOR`: This variable configures which estimator to use.
  Possible options are: `ekf2` (default), `lpe` (deprecated).
  It can be set via `export PX4_ESTIMATOR=lpe` before running the simulation.

The syntax described here is simplified, and there are many other options that you can configure via *make* - for example, to set that you wish to connect to an IDE or debugger.
For more information see: [Building the Code > PX4 Make Build Targets](../setup/building_px4.md#make_targets).

<a id="simulation_speed"></a>
#### Run Simulation Faster than Realtime

SITL can be run faster or slower than realtime when using jMAVSim or Gazebo.

The speed factor is set using the environment variable `PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR`.
For example, to run the jMAVSim simulation at 2 times the real time speed:
```
PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2 make px4_sitl jmavsim
```
To run at half real-time:
```
PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=0.5 make px4_sitl jmavsim
```

You can apply the factor to all SITL runs in the current session using `EXPORT`:
```
export PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2
make px4_sitl jmavsim
```

> **Note** At some point IO or CPU will limit the speed that is possible on your machine and it will be slowed down "automatically".
> Powerful desktop machines can usually run the simulation at around 6-10x, for notebooks the achieved rates can be around 3-4x.

<span></span>
> **Note** To avoid PX4 detecting data link timeouts, increase the value of param [COM_DL_LOSS_T](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#COM_DL_LOSS_T) proportional to the simulation rate.
  For example, if `COM_DL_LOSS_T` is 10 in realtime, at 10x simulation rate increase to 100.

#### Lockstep Simulation

PX4 SITL and the simulators (jMAVSim or Gazebo) have been set up to run in *lockstep*.
What this means is that PX4 and the simulator wait on each other for sensor and actuator messages, rather than running at their own speeds.

> **Note** Lockstep makes it possible to [run the simulation faster or slower than realtime](#simulation_speed), and also to pause it in order to step through code.

The sequence of steps for lockstep are:
1. The simulation sends a sensor message [HIL_SENSOR](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_SENSOR) including a timestamp `time_usec` to update the sensor state and time of PX4.
1. PX4 receives this and does one iteration of state estimation, controls, etc. and eventually sends an actuator message [HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS).
1. The simulation waits until it receives the actuator/motor message, then simulates the physics and calculates the next sensor message to send to PX4 again.

The system starts with a "freewheeling" period where the simulation sends sensor messages including time and therefore runs PX4 until it has initialized and responds with an actuator message.

##### Disable Lockstep Simulation

The lockstep simulation can be disabled if, for example, SITL is to be used with a simulator that does not support this feature.
In this case the simulator and PX4 use the host system time and do not wait on each other.

To disable lockstep in PX4, use `set(ENABLE_LOCKSTEP_SCHEDULER no)` in the [SITL board config](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/77097b6adc70afbe7e5d8ff9797ed3413e96dbf6/boards/px4/sitl/default.cmake#L104).

To disable lockstep in Gazebo, edit [the model SDF file](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/3062d287c322fabf1b41b8e33518eb449d4ac6ed/models/plane/plane.sdf#L449) and set `<enable_lockstep>false</enable_lockstep>` (or for Iris edit the [xacro file](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/3062d287c322fabf1b41b8e33518eb449d4ac6ed/models/rotors_description/urdf/iris_base.xacro#L22).

To disable lockstep in jMAVSim, remove `-l` in [jmavsim_run.sh](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/77097b6adc70afbe7e5d8ff9797ed3413e96dbf6/Tools/sitl_run.sh#L75), or make sure otherwise that the java binary is started without the `-lockstep` flag.

<a id="scripts"></a>
#### Startup Scripts

Scripts are used to control which parameter settings to use or which modules to start.
They are located in the [ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/tree/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix) directory, the `rcS` file is the main entry point.
See [System Startup](../concept/system_startup.md) for more information.

#### Simulating Failsafes and Sensor/Hardware Failure 

The [SITL parameters](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#sitl) can also be used to simulate common sensor failure cases, including low battery, loss of GPS or barometer, gyro failure, increased GPS noise etc.  (e.g. [SIM_GPS_BLOCK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#SIM_GPS_BLOCK) can be set to simulate GPS failure).

Additionally (and with some overlap), [Simulate Failsafes](../simulation/failsafes.md) explains how to trigger safety failsafes.


### HITL Simulation Environment

With Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation the normal PX4 firmware is run on real hardware.
The HITL Simulation Environment in documented in: [HITL Simulation](../simulation/hitl.md).


### Joystick/Gamepad Integration

*QGroundControl* desktop versions can connect to a USB Joystick/Gamepad and send its movement commands and button presses to PX4 over MAVLink.
This works on both SITL and HITL simulations, and allows you to directly control the simulated vehicle.
If you don't have a joystick you can alternatively control the vehicle using QGroundControl's onscreen virtual thumbsticks.

For setup information see the *QGroundControl User Guide*:
* [Joystick Setup](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/SetupView/Joystick.html)
* [Virtual Joystick](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/SettingsView/VirtualJoystick.html)

<!-- FYI Airsim info on this setting up remote controls: https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/remote_controls.md -->


#3# Camera Simulation

PX4 supports capture of both still images and video from within the [Gazebo](../simulation/gazebo.md) simulated environment.
This can be enabled/set up as described in [Gazebo > Video Streaming](../simulation/gazebo.md#video).

The simulated camera is a gazebo plugin that implements the [MAVLink Camera Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/protocol/camera.html)<!-- **PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/src/gazebo_geotagged_images_plugin.cpp -->.
PX4 connects/integrates with this camera in *exactly the same way* as it would with any other MAVLink camera:
1. [TRIG_INTERFACE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#TRIG_INTERFACE) must be set to `3` to configure the camera trigger driver for use with a MAVLink camera
   > **Tip** In this mode the driver just sends a [CAMERA_TRIGGER](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#CAMERA_TRIGGER) message whenever an image capture is requested.
     For more information see [Camera](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/peripherals/camera.html).
1. PX4 must forward all camera commands between the GCS and the (simulator) MAVLink Camera.
   You can do this by starting [MAVLink](../middleware/modules_communication.md#mavlink) with the `-f` flag as shown, specifying the UDP ports for the new connection.
   ```
   mavlink start -u 14558 -o 14530 -r 4000 -f -m camera
   ```
   > **Note** More than just the camera MAVLink messages will be forwarded, but the camera will ignore those that it doesn't consider relevant.

The same approach can be used by other simulators to implement camera support.

## Running Simulation on a Remote Server

It is possible to run the simulator on one computer, and access it from another computer on the same network (or on another network with appropriate routing).
This might be useful, for example, if you want to test a drone application running on real companion computer hardware running against a simulated vehicle.

This does not work "out of the box" because PX4 does not route packets to external interfaces by default (in order to avoid spamming the network and different simulations interfering with each other).
Instead it routes traffic internally - to "localhost".

There are a number of ways to make the UDP packets available on external interfaces, as outlined below.


### Enable MAV_BROADCAST

Enable [MAV_BROADCAST](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#MAV_BROADCAST) to broadcast heartbeats on the local network.

A remote computer can then connect to the simulator by listening to the appropriate port (i.e. 14550 for *QGroundControl*).


### Use MAVLink Router

The [mavlink-router](https://github.com/intel/mavlink-router) can be used to route packets from localhost to an external interface.

To route packets between SITL running on one computer (sending MAVLink traffic to localhost on UDP port 14550), and QGC running on another computer (e.g. at address `10.73.41.30`) you could:

- Start *mavlink-router* with the following command:
  ```
  mavlink-routerd -e 10.73.41.30:14550 127.0.0.1:14550
  ```
- Use a *mavlink-router* conf file.
  ```
  [UdpEndpoint QGC]
  Mode = Normal
  Address = 10.73.41.30
  Port = 14550

  [UdpEndpoint SIM]
  Mode = Eavesdropping
  Address = 127.0.0.1
  Port = 14550
  ```

> **Note** More information about *mavlink-router* configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/intel/mavlink-router/#running).


### Modify Configuration for External Broadcasting

The [mavlink](../middleware/modules_communication.md#mavlink_usage) module routes to *localhost* by default, but you can specify an external IP address to broadcast to using its `-t` option.

This should be done in various configuration files where `mavlink start` is called.
For example: [/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/rcS](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/rcS).


### SSH Tunneling

SSH tunneling is a flexible option because the simulation computer and the system using it need not be on the same network.

> **Note** You might similarly use VPN to provide a tunnel to an external interface (on the same network or another network).

One way to create the tunnel is to use SSH tunneling options.
The tunnel itself can be created by running the following command on *localhost*, where `remote.local` is the name of a remote computer:
```
ssh -C -fR 14551:localhost:14551 remote.local
```

The UDP packets need to be translated to TCP packets so they can be routed over SSH.
The [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) utility can be used on both sides of the tunnel - first to convert packets from UDP to TCP, and then back to UDP at the other end.

> **Tip** QGC must be running before executing *netcat*.

On the *QGroundControl* computer, UDP packet translation may be implemented by running following commands:
```
mkfifo /tmp/tcp2udp
netcat -lvp 14551 < /tmp/tcp2udp | netcat -u localhost 14550 > /tmp/tcp2udp
```
On the simulator side of the SSH tunnel, the command is:
```
mkfifo /tmp/udp2tcp
netcat -lvup 14550 < /tmp/udp2tcp | netcat localhost 14551 > /tmp/udp2tcp
```

The port number `14550` is valid for connecting to QGroundControl or another GCS, but should be adjusted for other endpoints (e.g. developer APIs etc.).

The tunnel may in theory run indefinitely, but *netcat* connections may need to be restarted if there is a problem.

The [QGC_remote_connect.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/sitl_gazebo/autogyro-sitl/scripts/QGC_remote_connect.bash) script can be run on the QGC computer to automatically setup/run the above instructions.
The simulation must already be running on the remote server, and you must be able to SSH into that server.
## Taking it to the Sky

The `make` commands above first build PX4, and then run it along with the Gazebo simulator.

Once PX4 has started it will launch the PX4 shell as shown below.

INFO  [ecl/EKF] 5188000: commencing GPS fusion
```
The console will print out status as PX4 loads the airframe-specific initialisation and parameter files, waits for (and connects to) the simulator.
Once there is an INFO print that [ecl/EKF] is `commencing GPS fusion` the vehicle is ready to arm.


:::note
Right-clicking the quadrotor model allows to enable follow mode from the context menu, which is handy to keep it in view.

You can bring it into the air by typing:

```sh
pxh> commander takeoff
```

## Usage/Configuration Options

Options that apply to all simulators are covered in the top level [Simulation](../simulation/README.md#sitl-simulation-environment) topic (some of these may be duplicated below).

### Simulating Sensor/Hardware Failure

[Simulate Failsafes](../simulation/failsafes.md) explains how to trigger safety failsafes like GPS failure and battery drain.

<a id="headless"></a>
### Headless Mode

Gazebo can be run in a *headless* mode in which the Gazebo UI is not launched.
This starts up more quickly and uses less system resources (i.e. it is a more "lightweight" way to run the simulation).

Simply prefix the normal `make` command with `HEADLESS=1` as shown:
```bash
HEADLESS=1 make px4_sitl gazebo_plane
```

<a id="custom_takeoff_location"></a>
### Set Custom Takeoff Location

The takeoff location in SITL Gazebo can be set using environment variables.
This will override both the default takeoff location, and any value [set for the world](#set_world_location).

The variables to set are: `PX4_HOME_LAT`, `PX4_HOME_LON`, and `PX4_HOME_ALT`.

For example:
```
export PX4_HOME_LAT=28.452386
export PX4_HOME_LON=-13.867138
export PX4_HOME_ALT=28.5
make px4_sitl gazebo
```


### Change Simulation Speed

The simulation speed can be increased or decreased with respect to realtime using the environment variable `PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR`.

```
export PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2
make px4_sitl_default gazebo
```

For more information see: [Simulation > Run Simulation Faster than Realtime](../simulation/README.md#simulation_speed).


### Change Wind Speed

To simulate wind speed, add this plugin to your world file and set `windVelocityMean` in m/s (replace `SET_YOUR_WIND_SPEED` with your desired speed).
If needed, adapt the `windVelocityMax` parameter so that it is greater than `windVelocityMean`:

```xml
  <plugin name='wind_plugin' filename='libgazebo_wind_plugin.so'>
      <frameId>base_link</frameId>
      <robotNamespace/>
      <windVelocityMean>SET_YOUR_WIND_SPEED</windVelocityMean>
      <windVelocityMax>20.0</windVelocityMax>
      <windVelocityVariance>0</windVelocityVariance>
      <windDirectionMean>0 1 0</windDirectionMean>https://youtu.be/-a2WWLni5do
      <windDirectionVariance>0</windDirectionVariance>
      <windGustStart>0</windGustStart>
      <windGustDuration>0</windGustDuration>
      <windGustVelocityMean>0</windGustVelocityMean>
      <windGustVelocityMax>20.0</windGustVelocityMax>
      <windGustVelocityVariance>0</windGustVelocityVariance>
      <windGustDirectionMean>1 0 0</windGustDirectionMean>
      <windGustDirectionVariance>0</windGustDirectionVariance>
      <windPubTopic>world_wind</windPubTopic>
    </plugin>
```
Wind direction is passed as a direction vector (standard ENU convention), which will be normalized in the gazebo plugin.
Additionally you can state wind velocity variance in (m/s)² and direction variance based on a normal distribution to add some random factor into the simulation.
Gust is internally handled in the same way as wind, with the slight difference that you can state start time and duration with the following two parameters `windGustStart` and `windGustDuration`.

You can see how this is done in [PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo/worlds/windy.world](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo/blob/master/worlds/windy.world#L15-L31).

### Using a Joystick

Joystick and thumb-joystick support are supported through *QGroundControl* ([setup instructions here](../simulation/README.md#joystick-gamepad-integration)).


### Improving Distance Sensor Performance

The current default world is [PX4/sitl_gazebo/worlds/**iris.world**](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/tree/master/worlds)), which uses a heightmap as ground.

This can cause difficulty when using a distance sensor.
If there are unexpected results we recommend you change the model in **iris.model** from `uneven_ground` to `asphalt_plane`.


<a id="gps_noise"></a>
### Simulating GPS Noise

Gazebo can simulate GPS noise that is similar to that typically found in real systems (otherwise reported GPS values will be noise-free/perfect).
This is useful when working on applications that might be impacted by GPS noise - e.g. precision positioning.

GPS noise is enabled if the target vehicle's SDF file contains a value for the `gpsNoise` element (i.e. it has the line: `<gpsNoise>true</gpsNoise>`).
It is enabled by default in many vehicle SDF files: **solo.sdf**, **iris.sdf**, **standard_vtol.sdf**, **delta_wing.sdf**, **plane.sdf**, **typhoon_h480**, **tailsitter.sdf**.

To enable/disable GPS noise:
1. Build any gazebo target in order to generate SDF files (for all vehicles).
   For example:
   ```
   make px4_sitl gazebo_iris
   ```
   :::tip
   The SDF files are not overwritten on subsequent builds.
   :::
   
2. Open the SDF file for your target vehicle (e.g. **./Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf**).
3. Search for the `gpsNoise` element:
   ```xml
   <plugin name='gps_plugin' filename='libgazebo_gps_plugin.so'>
     <robotNamespace/>
     <gpsNoise>true</gpsNoise>
   </plugin>
   ```
   * If it is present, GPS is enabled.
     You can disable it by deleting the line: `<gpsNoise>true</gpsNoise>`
   * If it is not present, GPS is disabled.
     You can enable it by adding the `gpsNoise` element to the `gps_plugin` section (as shown above).

The next time you build/restart Gazebo it will use the new GPS noise setting.


<a id="set_world"></a>
## Loading a Specific World

PX4 supports a number of [Gazebo Worlds](../simulation/gazebo_worlds.md), which are stored in [PX4/sitl_gazebo/worlds](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/tree/master/worlds))
By default Gazebo displays a flat featureless plane, as defined in [empty.world](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/master/worlds/empty.world).

You can load any of the worlds by specifying them as the final option in the PX4 configuration target.

For example, to load the *warehouse* world, you can append it as shown:
```
make px4_sitl_default gazebo_plane_cam__warehouse
```

:::note
There are *two underscores* after the model (`plane_cam`) indicating that the default debugger is used (none).
See [Building the Code > PX4 Make Build Targets](../dev_setup/building_px4.md#px4-make-build-targets).
:::

You can also specify the full path to a world to load using the `PX4_SITL_WORLD` environment variable.
This is useful if testing a new world that is not yet included with PX4.

:::tip
If the loaded world does not align with the map, you may need to [set the world location](#set_world_location).
:::

<a id="set_world_location"></a>
## Set World Location

The vehicle gets spawned very close to the origin of the world model at some simulated GPS location.

:::note
The vehicle is not spawned exactly at the Gazebo origin (0,0,0), but using a slight offset, which can highlight a number of common coding issues. 
:::

If using a world that recreates a real location (e.g. a particular airport) this can result in a very obvious mismatch between what is displayed in the simulated world, and what is shown on the ground station map.
To overcome this problem you can set the location of the world origin to the GPS co-ordinates where it would be in "real life".

:::note
You can also set a [Custom Takeoff Location](#custom_takeoff_location) that does the same thing.
However adding the location to the map is easier (and can still be over-ridden by setting a custom location if needed).
:::

The location of the world is defined in the **.world** file by specifying the location of the origin using the `spherical_coordinates` tag.
The latitude, longitude, elevation must all be specified (for this to be a valid).

An example can be found in the [sonoma_raceway.world](https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/blob/master/worlds/sonoma_raceway.world):
```
    <spherical_coordinates>
      <surface_model>EARTH_WGS84</surface_model>
      <latitude_deg>38.161479</latitude_deg>
      <longitude_deg>-122.454630</longitude_deg>
      <elevation>488.0</elevation>
    </spherical_coordinates>
```

You can test this by spawning a rover in the [Sonoma Raceway World](../simulation/gazebo_worlds.md#sonoma-raceway) using the following `make` command (note that spawning takes longer the first time as the model needs to be downloaded from the model database):
```
make px4_sitl gazebo_rover__sonoma_raceway
```

The video below shows that the location of the environment is aligned with the gazebo world:

<a id="start_px4_sim_separately"></a>
## Starting Gazebo and PX4 Separately

For extended development sessions it might be more convenient to start Gazebo and PX4 separately or even from within an IDE.

In addition to the existing cmake targets that run `sitl_run.sh` with parameters for px4 to load the correct model it creates a launcher targets named `px4_<mode>` that is a thin wrapper around original sitl px4 app.
This thin wrapper simply embeds app arguments like current working directories and the path to the model file.

To start Gazebo and PX4 separately:

* Run gazebo (or any other sim) server and client viewers via the terminal specifing an `_ide` variant:
  ```sh
  make px4_sitl gazebo___ide
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  make px4_sitl gazebo_iris_ide
  ```
* In your IDE select `px4_<mode>` target you want to debug (e.g. `px4_iris`)
* Start the debug session directly from IDE

This approach significantly reduces the debug cycle time because simulator (e.g. Gazebo) is always running in background and you only re-run the px4 process which is very light.


## Simulated Survey Camera

The *Gazebo* survey camera simulates a [MAVLink camera](https://mavlink.io/en/services/camera.html) that captures geotagged JPEG images and sends camera capture information to a connected ground station.
The camera also supports video streaming.
It can be used to test camera capture, in particular within survey missions.

The camera emits the [CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED) message every time an image is captured.
The captured images are saved to: **PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitle_default/tmp/frames/DSC_n_.jpg** (where _n_ starts as 00000 and is iterated by one on each capture).

To simulate a plane with this camera:
```
make px4_sitl_default gazebo_plane_cam
```

:::note
The camera also supports/responds to the following MAVLink commands: [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS), [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION), [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS), [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION), [MAV_CMD_RESET_CAMERA_SETTINGS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_RESET_CAMERA_SETTINGS), [MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT), [MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_ZOOM](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_ZOOM), [MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE), [MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE), [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION), [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_STATUS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_STATUS), [MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE).
:::

:::note
The simulated camera is implemented in [PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo/master/src/gazebo_camera_manager_plugin.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo/blob/master/src/gazebo_camera_manager_plugin.cpp). 
:::

<a id="flight_termination"></a>
## Simulated Parachute/Flight Termination

*Gazebo* can be used to simulate deploying a [parachute](../peripherals/parachute.md) during [Flight Termination](../advanced_config/flight_termination.md) (flight termination is triggered by the PWM command that is simulated in *Gazebo*).

The `if750a` target has a parachute attached to the vehicle.
To simulate the vehicle, run the following command:
```
make px4_sitl gazebo_if750a
```

To put the vehicle into flight termination state, you can force it to fail a [safety check](../config/safety.md) that has flight termination set as the failsafe action.
For example, you could do this by forcing a [Geofence violation](../config/safety.md#geofence-failsafe).

For more information see:
- [Flight Termination](../advanced_config/flight_termination.md) 
- [Parachute](../peripherals/parachute.md)
- [Safety Configuration (Failsafes)](../config/safety.md)

<a id="video"></a>
## Video Streaming

PX4 SITL for Gazebo supports UDP video streaming from a Gazebo camera sensor attached to a vehicle model.
When streaming is enabled, you can connect to this stream from *QGroundControl* (on UDP port 5600) and view video of the Gazebo environment from the simulated vehicle - just as you would from a real camera.
The video is streamed using a *gstreamer* pipeline and can be enabled/disabled using a button in the Gazebo UI.

The Gazebo camera sensor is supported/enabled on the following frames:
* [Typhoon H480](#typhoon_h480)


### Prerequisites

*Gstreamer 1.0* is required for video streaming.
The required dependencies should already have been [installed when you set up Gazebo](#installation) (they are included in the standard PX4 installation scripts/instructions for macOS and Ubuntu Linux).

:::note
FYI only, the dependencies include: `gstreamer1.0-plugins-base`, g`streamer1.0-plugins-good`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`, `libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev`.
:::

### Start/Stop Video Streaming

Video streaming is automatically started when supported by the target vehicle.
For example, to start streaming video on the Typhoon H480:
```
make px4_sitl gazebo_typhoon_h480
```

Streaming can be paused/restarted using the Gazebo UI *Video ON/OFF* button..

![Video ON/OFF button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/154635357-193ab366-441d-4828-bd74-73b6918d8f62.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/154635357-193ab366-441d-4828-bd74-73b6918d8f62.png)


### How to View Gazebo Video

The easiest way to view the SITL/Gazebo camera video stream is in *QGroundControl*.
Simply open **Application Settings > General** and set **Video Source** to *UDP h.264 Video Stream* and **UDP Port** to *5600*:
  
![QGC Video Streaming Settings for Gazebo](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/qgc_gazebo_video_stream_udp.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/154636082-55f7658b-ebae-4bea-8a4b-8e0b753fc1c6.png)

The video from Gazebo should then display in *QGroundControl* just as it would from a real camera.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/154636092-cb578bb2-dedc-45f7-8eb9-a010249d580d.png)

![QGC Video Streaming Gazebo Example](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/qgc_gazebo_video_stream_typhoon.jpg)

:::note
The Typhoon world is not very interesting.
:::

It is also possible to view the video using the *Gstreamer Pipeline*.
Simply enter the following terminal command:
```sh
gst-launch-1.0  -v udpsrc port=5600 caps='application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264' \
! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink fps-update-interval=1000 sync=false
```

### Verbose Logging

SITL fails silently when there is something wrong with the gazebo model.
You can enable more verbose logging using `VERBOSE_SIM`, as shown:

```
export VERBOSE_SIM=1
make px4_sitl gazebo
```

or 

```
VERBOSE_SIM=1 make px4_sitl gazebo
```


## Extending and Customizing

To extend or customize the simulation interface, edit the files in the `Tools/sitl_gazebo` folder.
The code is available on the [sitl_gazebo repository](https://github.com/px4/sitl_gazebo) on Github.

:::note
The build system enfor../../assets/simulation/gazebo/sitl_video_stream.png)ces the correct GIT submodules, including the simulator.
It will not overwrite changes in files in the directory.
