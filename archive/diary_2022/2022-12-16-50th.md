## 2023
### my vision
1. yoga - get back to my routines for the day and for the night.
2. jogging - my goal is to run 65Km for the week
3. reading - reading a novel or nonfiction at least one book every two weeks.
4. coding - C# and C++ fun coding with examples - for visualization, simulations, drones and games.
5. career - getting into action would be worth more than thousands of words.
