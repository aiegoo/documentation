Dear Mr. Cho,
Hello again.
I must say today is the happiest day in a long time. I have fixed some troubling issues I had with my [documentation site](https://pf3.36io.co), which has been bothering me for the last couple of days. And today I did it from my mobile phone. 

Thank you again for the opportunity. I am eager to make a positive contribution to the company and to work with everyone on this project team and of course, Joydrone corporate members as myself being one.

I look forward to starting employment and if there is any additional information or paperwork you need prior to then, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Tonylee
