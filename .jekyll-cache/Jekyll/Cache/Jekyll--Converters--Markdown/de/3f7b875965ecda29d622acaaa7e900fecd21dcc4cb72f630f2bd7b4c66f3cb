I"Ú<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I was on a mission to join the workforce; my portfolio and its project details have grown very fast for the last three months. They are purely based on the fictional ideas and themes I created for the purpose of my portfolio and projects.</p>

<p>If credits I have inserted along the way are not enough to satisfy the standards of business or not fulfilling the required criteria, please allow me to apologize and I will do my best to amend and reflect or scrap away the questionable projects entirely. I owe everything to you and my teachers.</p>

<p>On Mar 8, 2019 as I wrapped up my NCS course and joined Onofflink for my first stint in a real job. This was the beginning of my developer career, then continued the same path with Jiseoan where I found my true passion on mobility and aiot integration. In 2021, Iâ€™ve been looking forward to making this road of learning a reality.</p>
