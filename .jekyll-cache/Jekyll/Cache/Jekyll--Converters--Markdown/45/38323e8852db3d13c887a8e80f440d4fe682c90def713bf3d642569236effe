<p>This is my first web page I have created, without any css, html or jquery snippets being used. Itâ€™s been pride of my savvy impromptu skills of survival. 4 years ago.</p>

<ul>
  <li>my wordpress theme customization
    <ul>
      <li>now dyfunct tonyleekorea.com has been in service for the last 2 years, with my portfolio and profile including cvs being kept with it.</li>
      <li>cariana.tonyleekorea.com was a very simple shopping web app with no cart, no payment options.</li>
      <li>then I have created more extensive shopping cart from cafe24 almost 4 years ago, which is still in service, with all the frills and jingles of shopping mall site would need. <a href="https://yogaman.club">yogaman</a></li>
