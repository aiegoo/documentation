> Overview


> Typhoon H Hexacopter 

> Autonomous flight modes allow you to recall pre-programmed tracking shots while focusing on the camera:

Orbit Me: Typhoon H flies a circular path around you, keeping the camera trained on you the whole time.
Point of Interest (POI): Select a subject and Typhoon H will orbit that subject autonomously.
Journey Mode: Typhoon H will automatically go up and out, as far as 90 m, and capture the perfect aerial selfie.
Follow Me / Watch Me: Follow Me ensures Typhoon H moves along with you. Watch Me tells Typhoon H to follow you while always pointing the camera at you wherever you go.
```
Curve Cable Cam: Easily program an invisible route for Typhoon H to fly along. Typhoon H will fly between pre-set coordinates while independently controlling camera position.
Return Home: Simply switch to Home Mode and Typhoon H will return and land within 8 m of you.
```

> CGOET Thermal Imaging And Low-Light Camera

The CGOET is an innovative combination of 3-axis gimbal, thermal imaging camera and low-light camera. While the thermal imaging camera selectively measures the temperature in the image enabling it to display relative temperature differences, the low-light RGB camera has a 20 times higher sensitivity than the human eye and can still take excellent shots even in low light conditions. Both images are streamed live on your remote control at the same time, and can be viewed separately as a picture-in-picture or as an overlay. The CGOET gimbal is capable of continuous 360° yaw axis rotation. This unique feature, when combined with the H520 retractable landing gear, provides the operator with continuous 360 unobstructed camera view and the ability to continuously pan the camera without yawing the airframe.

> ST16 All-in-One Transmitter


> Scope Of Delivery

The Typhoon H with CGOET includes: Typhoon H hexacopter, CGOET thermal imaging and low-light camera, ST16 remote control, 1 battery, user manual and accessories.
