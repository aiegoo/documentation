# Airframe/Vehicle Builds

PX4 supports numerous types of vehicles, including different configurations of multicopters, planes, VTOL vehicles, ground vehicles, etc. The complete set of supported configurations can be seen in the [Airframes Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).

This section contains instructions for how to install several different [flight controllers](../flight_controller/README.md) on a number of common frames.
