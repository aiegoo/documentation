## how it began

It's a question rather than a reason why I get started with this mini project. After a long five-year pause, am I ready to resume my career as an English language specialist? I've been a teacher, translator and linguistic enthisast for my entire life? Love and hate in that matter too. 

{: .note}
I have created a couple of features relavant to the task at hand, such as creating a syllabus and making collections of lecture contents. So I will try to build a small lecture archive here for Yonhee, with book links and daily dose of handouts.
