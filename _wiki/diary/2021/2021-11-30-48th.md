## how it began

It's a question rather than a reason why I get started with this mini project. After a long five-year pause, am I ready to resume my career as an English language specialist? I've been a teacher, translator and linguistic enthisast for my entire life? Love and hate in that matter too.

{: .note}
I have created a couple of features relavant to the task at hand, such as creating a syllabus and making collections of lecture contents. So I will try to build a small lecture archive here for Yonhee, with book links and daily dose of handouts.

## syllabus
Depending on get-to-know interviews, start with the flashcards for two or three sessions, proceeding to 100words and cartooning. End with the justenoughgrammar, which would be the stepping stone to more fun reading materials.
