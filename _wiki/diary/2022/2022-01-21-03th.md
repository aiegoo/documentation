00:00
hello there and welcome back to the
00:01
channel today we're taking a look at
00:02
smart link from sky drones now smart
00:05
link is a haich-d wireless video
00:07
transmission and telemetry system it's
00:09
designed to be used with various auto
00:11
pilots and it allows you to transmit HD
00:13
video up to 1080p back to a ground
00:16
station up to 20 kilometers in range not
00:19
only does it support video but it also
00:21
has a marvelling telemetry connection as
00:24
well UART and it also has a built in
00:26
companion computer so it allows you to
00:29
run onboard software on the aircraft as
00:31
well connect it up to USB and actually
00:33
have control over that via the ground
00:36
station too now this system is
00:38
compatible with marvelling which means
00:39
it will work with autopilot as well as
00:42
px4 but it also works with sky drones
00:45
own flight controller as well you can
00:47
use it with the sky drones ground
00:48
station software but you can also use it
00:51
with mission planner as well if you are
00:53
using that on this system now what we're
00:56
going to do in this video is give you
00:57
guys an overview of what it does take
00:59
you through a closer look at the ear
01:01
unit as well as the ground station as
01:03
well and then at the end of the video
01:04
I'm going to give you guys a quick demo
01:06
of just the video transmitting on both
01:08
their ground station as well as mission
01:10
planner of two now in another video I'm
01:13
going to actually give you guys a demo
01:14
of this out in action and try and show
01:16
you what it's actually like and test
01:18
some of that 20 kilometer range method
01:20
as well and see how it actually holds up
01:23
now just before I jump into the specs
01:25
detailed on this one thing I will
01:26
mention with this system is that it
01:28
doesn't have a built in RC control link
01:31
it handles video and telemetry but it
01:33
doesn't have RC so if you're going to
01:35
use a system like this you're still
01:37
going to need to use your traditional RC
01:39
for doing your main aircraft control and
01:42
whilst if you are using audre pilot you
01:44
can actually control it fully over
01:46
marvelling you're always going to want
01:48
your RC control backup as well and it is
01:51
worth checking that out so the next
01:53
thing we're going to do is take a closer
01:54
look over the unit itself and then give
01:57
you guys an overview of some of the
01:58
specs and the features that the
01:59
SmartLink includes
02:01
[Music]
02:05
SmartLink is a telemetry and HD video
02:08
transmission system that is designed to
02:10
be used with their own smart AP flight
02:12
controllers but it also supports
02:14
marvelling which means it will also work
02:15
with pixhawk and other controllers that
02:17
support both Ardra pilot and px4 it has
02:21
a range of up to 20 kilometers and is
02:23
AES encrypted and it supports video
02:26
telemetry over the wireless link taking
02:30
a closer look at the e unit itself not
02:32
only does it handle the video input and
02:34
transmission but it has an onboard
02:35
companion computer as well now this
02:37
companion is an arm cortex a53 quad-core
02:41
up to 1.2 gigahertz it has 1 gig of ram
02:44
and 4 gig of on-board storage and this
02:47
allows you to run custom applications
02:49
directly on the ear unit so you don't
02:51
actually have to have a separate
02:53
companion computer on your unit now the
02:56
radio system on this uses a dual antenna
02:58
input and it supports the 2.4 gigahertz
03:00
frequency band it has a boundaries of
03:02
either 4 or 8 megahertz and as I
03:04
mentioned earlier it supports AES
03:06
encryption now video latency on this
03:09
system is said to be below 100
03:11
milliseconds on either HDMI inputs and
03:14
it has a maximum range of up to 20
03:16
kilometers moving around to the sides
03:19
you will find a microSD card input for
03:22
the companion computer as well as the
03:23
two HDMI video inputs now these support
03:27
up to a maximum of 1080p 60 frames a
03:29
second and could be selected via the
03:31
software on the other side you will find
03:33
the reset as well as the microUSB port
03:36
to SPI ports and i2c port on the uart
03:40
port above this you will also have the
03:42
five volt DC input
03:44
now these SPI and new out ports are
03:47
designed to allow you to connect it to
03:48
your autopilot for getting additional
03:50
data such as your telemetry but it also
03:52
allows you to connect additional sensors
03:55
directly to the e unit as well rather
03:58
than routing them directly through your
03:59
flight controller moving around to the
04:02
back you will find two USB a ports and
04:04
these are for connecting external
04:06
devices directly to the on-board
04:08
companion on each side of the ear unit
04:11
you have the SMA antenna connectors and
04:13
then on the one side at the back you
04:15
have a fan which keeps
04:17
onboard electronics cool underneath
04:20
there's no connections and you simply
04:21
have a little bit of a conformity
04:23
labeling and this is where you would be
04:24
mounting it directly to your frame
04:26
moving over to the ground station this
04:29
is what receives the signal from the ear
04:31
unit and then you connect this to either
04:33
your computer or your tablet depending
04:36
on what setup you're going to use now
04:38
this unit is housed in an aluminium case
04:40
with a fan located just behind the sky
04:43
drones logo at the front it has to SMA
04:47
antenna inputs at the top and has a 7 to
04:50
35 volt DC input on the bottom alongside
04:54
the micro USB connector that you will
04:56
connect to either your computer or
04:58
tablet moving around to the other side
05:00
you will find the status LEDs which
05:02
gives you information for the tx/rx
05:04
and link condition onboard CPU as well
05:07
as signal RSSI which is split across
05:10
three LEDs finally on the back you
05:13
simply have the conformity labeling just
05:15
like on the ear unit now looking closer
05:18
at the specification the system supports
05:20
HD video to 1080p 60 frames a second
05:23
down to 720p 30 frames a second as I
05:26
mentioned earlier the telemetry inputs
05:28
support TX and rx via you are tll and it
05:31
supports marvelling so it means it will
05:33
work with pixhawk and other flight
05:35
controllers it also allows obviously
05:37
control over the telemetry link as well
05:39
now the weight of the unit is 75 grams
05:42
for the ear module and 70 grams for the
05:44
ground station and whilst the ear unit
05:46
only supports 5 volt DC the ground unit
05:49
will support 7 240 included with the
05:52
smart leg is the antennas and these
05:54
consist of two omnidirectional
05:56
self-adhesive panel mount antennas for
05:59
the ear end which simply connect via
06:01
wires onto the SMA connectors and on the
06:04
ground end they supply to two point four
06:07
gigs high gain omnidirectional stick
06:09
antennas made by tp-link now as I
06:13
mentioned you can use smart link with
06:15
px4 or autopilot and any pixhawk or cube
06:18
flight controller now here I've got it
06:20
connected up to a cube orange via the
06:22
UART one poor now the standard cable
06:25
supplied with it doesn't actually
06:26
directly fit and you will need to make
06:28
one up yourself to make sure that you do
06:30
get the connection
06:31
correct not to be able to receive the
06:34
video and telemetry data you can hook
06:35
smart link directly to mission planner
06:37
however they do also make their own
06:40
ground station software called Smart AP
06:42
GCS and this does have support for audre
06:46
pilot and px for over marvelling and
06:48
whilst it is designed to be used with
06:50
their own flight controllers you do have
06:52
some functionality in this as well and
06:54
it does allow you to actually receive
06:56
that data directly on their ground
06:58
station as well as control the smart
07:00
link video as well taking a closer look
07:03
over their own ground station here you
07:06
will see you have all of the basic
07:07
functionality that you get from most
07:09
ground stations in the top right hand
07:10
corner you have the connection box for
07:12
connecting to the smart link unit itself
07:14
then along the top you have all of the
07:17
basic telemetry data as well as the
07:18
smart link ear unit data - by
07:21
double-clicking on the little antenna
07:22
you have all of the basic signal
07:24
information as well as the settings
07:26
appear for the smart link here you can
07:29
change things such as the main frequency
07:31
you can change the bandwidth for the
07:33
channels ear end power as well as ground
07:36
station power and also the ability to
07:41
set a maximum distance as well under the
07:44
security tab you have the ability to
07:46
change this user and password ID
07:48
settings for the AES encryption coming
07:52
out of here in the bottom corner you
07:53
will see the video box now currently
07:56
this is showing blank because I haven't
07:57
actually selected the video input if you
07:59
click the little cog in the bottom
08:00
corner and select smart link HDMI after
08:03
a second or two the main video input
08:06
will appear now I've currently got this
08:08
connected to my gh 5 looking at the ear
08:10
unit on the bench now you can select the
08:13
HDMI inputs by the options in the
08:15
right-hand side and once it is connected
08:17
you have the ability to move the video
08:19
screen about floating depending on where
08:21
you want to put it you can also swap it
08:23
between fullscreen and normal size and
08:25
you can also adjust the size of the
08:27
screen as well depending on how large
08:30
you want it now to do the adjustment you
08:32
simply go down to the bottom right hand
08:33
corner and drag it smaller and larger or
08:36
you simply double tap on the screen to
08:38
swap it between fullscreen and then it
08:40
makes the map screen smaller rather than
08:42
the camera itself now
08:44
looking around the rest of the ground
08:45
station you have all of the usual
08:46
functionality such as the mode buttons
08:48
down the right hand side you have a
08:50
recording option and I also have the
08:53
ability to fact either the HDMI one or
08:55
HDMI to input depending on which one
08:58
you're using then along the top you have
09:01
all of the usual telemetry data you'd
09:03
expect to find from an odd row pilot or
09:05
px4 based flight controller you have the
09:07
arm switch and then you have the main
09:09
settings and frame options over under
09:12
the little cog on the right-hand side
09:13
that allows you just to change the
09:15
settings on the flight controller as
09:16
well as the other options too now it
09:19
should be said that this ground station
09:21
is designed to be used with their own
09:23
flight controller and you may find not
09:25
all of this functions when using a Ardra
09:28
pilot or px4 based one however it does
09:31
give you some of the options and as i've
09:33
said earlier you can continue to use
09:35
mission planner if you wanted to as well
09:37
if you prefer to use it that way just to
09:41
demo this in mission planner as well you
09:43
would simply set up the streaming
09:44
options as found on the sky drones
09:46
website put that in and once you've got
09:48
it all connected it will then
09:49
synchronize and then the video will
09:51
appear over the back end of the HUD now
09:55
just like whenever you use a streaming
09:57
device in mission planner you have all
09:59
the same options available to you you
10:01
have the live video over the heads-up
10:02
display and then you can pop it out to
10:05
full screen if you want to you can
10:06
adjust the size of it and you still have
10:08
all of the usual telemetry options as
10:10
well just as you would do using a normal
10:13
telemetry link now because this system
10:15
doesn't have an RC you would still need
10:17
a separate RC control link as there is
10:20
no SBUs but it does give you all of the
10:23
functionality from Mission planner to be
10:24
able to control your autopilot your
10:27
plane drone or ground unit depending on
10:30
what you want to do and you can simply
10:32
go in change all the prams as you
10:33
normally would and then go back to the
10:35
main screen and you have your video in
10:37
place ready to go and that is pretty
10:40
much it for this video now in my next
10:42
one I'm gonna take it out and about and
10:43
try and demonstrate some of the range
10:44
capabilities of it and actually show you
10:46
it in use as well now on the bench I'll
10:48
have to say the latency is actually
10:50
showing up very good certainly no issues
10:53
at all I haven't done any time
10:54
measurements on it but I get a feeling
10:57
for
10:57
and see when you've been testing digital
10:59
systems for a lot of time like I have
11:00
and it's certainly nothing I'm concerned
11:03
with at all again you're not going to be
11:05
mounting this on a racing drone so I'm
11:06
not looking at the same kind of latency
11:08
levels that DJI are getting down at sub
11:11
30 milliseconds they say a hundred
11:13
milliseconds from my personal bench test
11:15
and I can well believe that I need to
11:17
test what it is like out and about at
11:19
range as well and I'll be doing that in
11:21
the next video now it is an interesting
11:22
system that does have the onboard
11:24
companion in the year unit as well as
11:26
does another of other systems the nice
11:28
thing with this one is that it does
11:29
allow you to build it into a ground
11:31
station with the separate base unit
11:33
rather than have say an all-in-one RC
11:35
unit but it all depends what you're
11:37
going to want to do with your system and
11:39
depends if you're going to connect it up
11:40
to their own flight controller from sky
11:42
drones or you're going to be using it
11:43
with something like px4 or Ardra pilot
11:45
because it is fully compatible with both
11:47
so what we're doing the next one is
11:49
we'll get it out and about and demo it
11:51
in action d2 if you've liked what you've
11:53
seen in this video please do subscribe
11:55
to the channel there's a button in the
11:56
bottom right hand corner and if you
11:58
press that you'll get updates on any
11:59
videos that we release in the future
12:00
please do like and share if you've got
12:03
any comments on this please toss them in
12:05
the video as well put them in the
12:06
comment section and I will try to answer
12:08
any questions I have as well that's it
12:11
thank you for watching and I will do
12:12
another one again soon
