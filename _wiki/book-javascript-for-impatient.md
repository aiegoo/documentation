### 다루는 내용

In Chapter 1, we get going with the basic concepts of JavaScript: values and their types, variables, and most importantly, object literals. Chapter 2 covers control flow. <!--more--> You can probably skim over it quickly if you are familiar with Java, C#, or C++. In Chapter 3, you will learn about functions and functional programming, which is very important in JavaScript. JavaScript has an object model that is very different from class-based programming languages. Chapter 4 goes into detail, with a focus on modern syntax. Chapters 5 and 6 cover the library classes that you will most often use for working with numbers, dates, strings, and regular expressions. These chapters are largely at the basic level, with a sprinkling of more advanced sections.

The next four chapters cover intermediate level topics. In Chapter 7, you will see how to work with arrays and the other collections that the standard JavaScript library offers. If your programs interact with users from around the world, you will want to pay special attention to the coverage of internationalization in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 on asynchronous programming is very important for all programmers. Asynchronous programming used to be quite complex in JavaScript, but it has become much simpler with the introduction of promises and the async and await keywords. JavaScript now has a standard module system that is the topic of Chapter 10. You will see how to use modules that other programmers have written, and to produce your own.

Chapter 11 covers metaprogramming at an advanced level. You will want to read this chapter if you need to create tools that analyze and transform arbitrary JavaScript objects. Chapter 12 completes the coverage of JavaScript with another advanced topic: iterators and generators, which are powerful mechanisms for visiting and producing arbitrary sequences of values.

Finally, there is a bonus chapter, Chapter 13, on TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds compile-time typing. It is not a part of standard JavaScript, but it is very popular. Read this chapter to decide whether you want to stick with plain JavaScript or use compile-time types.

The purpose of this book is to give you a firm grounding of the JavaScript language so that you can use it with confidence. However, you will need to turn elsewhere for the ever-changing landscape of tools and frameworks.
