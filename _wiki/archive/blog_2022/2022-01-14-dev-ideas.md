## readme

### Unity App
 - webapp developed mainly with Unity
 - BLE used to sync with most H/W
 - Http protocol used for data exchange via API Server
 - For map application, `Web View` is used for data syncing

### Docker
 - Virtual deploy environment for API apps created with IIS, ASP.NET

### IIS
 - Reverse Proxy
 - Load balancing for ASP instances for any request

### Web
 - `React` is used for map views 
 - Native SDK offers limited apis
 - Found more convient in the case of API Server(ASP)

### ASP.NET
 - `User Management`, `Sensor Control` are handled by this API Server
 - Initial develpment and staging will be done with one instance
 - Load balancing is done by scaling out in sync with IIS Setting

## development environment
 - `Unity`

### Deploy apps
 - `Android`
 - `IOS`

### project structure 
- Assets
    + 01.Scenes
    + 02.Scripts
    + 03.Images
    + 04.Audio
    + 05.Fonts
    + Editor
    + Plugins
    + Resources

## Devwork
 - `ASP.NET` (.NET Core 3.1)
 - `Template` (WebAPI)

### Deploy settings
 - need more details for deploy settings
 - `Windows Server 2016`
 - `IIS`

### Technical Architecture
- MaaS.sln
    + Common
    + WebAPI
        * Attribute : API attributes and params defined
        * Controllers : API Route, to sync with Swaggers using comments
        * Database : Model DB definition
        * Middleware : ASP Custom Middleware
        * Models : Controller Model
        * Request : Controller request
        * Settings : ASP startup config variables
        * Map(`Web`) : ASP hosts map views that will be sent to web

### reference structure
* MaaS
    + WebAPI
        - Common
        - Map

### coding convention
- basic use of `Cammel` naming convention
- Sibling variables are added with `_`

### build method
```
dotnet build
dotnet build --runtime win10-x64
```
```
dotnet publish -c Release
dotnet publish -c Release --runtime win10-x64 --self-contained true
```
