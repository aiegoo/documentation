![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151573358-e5202a94-e79e-4aa8-8d9e-4b97bf8deedd.png)

If you are connected to AIRLink using WiFi Access Point mode and your computer doesn't support local DNS, you would need to use IP address 10.42.0.1 instead of airlink.local.
That's all you need for the development and we assume now you know what to do :)
Root access
SSH root access is not available as standard for security and safety reasons. However, this can be provided by Sky-Drones upon request. Please  to get an access.

### Read / Write MAVLink Telemetry data
SmartAP AIRLink provides user access for MAVLink telemetry stream which is useful for 3rd party applications development where you need to have access to the data from / to Autopilot and to / from Ground Control Station.
AIRLink supports 3 ports for user applications: 2 absolutely independent UDP ports and 1 TCP port for third party apps access:
```yaml
#
Type
Host
Port
Protocol
1
UDP
127.0.0.1
14560
MAVLink
2
UDP
127.0.0.1
14561
MAVLink
3
TCP
127.0.0.1
14556
```
MAVLink
For developer's convenience we offer code samples for reading and writing MAVLink messages. This example displays how to read HEARTBEAT message from the other MAVLink nodes and send HEARTBEAT from our example.

### UDP Example
```yaml
Read / write MAVLink using UDP connection:
#!/usr/bin/python3
# Usage example of MAVLink UDP port for user applications
# To execute:
#     python3 heartbeat_example_udp.py

​
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    # use default arguments if no arguments given from command line
    srcSystem = mavlink.MAV_COMP_ID_USER1
    remote_address = "127.0.0.1:14560"
else:
    # use arguments from command line
    srcSystem = int(sys.argv[2])
    remote_address = sys.argv[1]
​
# create connection
mav = mavutil.mavlink_connection(
    'udpout:' + remote_address, source_system=srcSystem)
​
​
def sender_loop():
    while True:
        mav.mav.heartbeat_send(mavlink.MAV_TYPE_GENERIC,
                               mavlink.MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID,

​
​
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    srcSystem = mavlink.MAV_COMP_ID_USER2
    remote_address = "127.0.0.1:14556"
else:
    srcSystem = int(sys.argv[2])
    remote_address = sys.argv[1]
​
mav = mavutil.mavlink_connection(
    'tcp:' + remote_address, source_system=srcSystem)
​
​
def sender_loop():
    while True:
        mav.mav.heartbeat_send(mavlink.MAV_TYPE_GENERIC,
                               mavlink.MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID,
                               mavlink.MAV_MODE_FLAG_CUSTOM_MODE_ENABLED,
                               0,
                               mavlink.MAV_STATE_STANDBY)
        time.sleep(2)
​
​
send_thread = Thread(target=sender_loop)
send_thread.daemon = True
send_thread.start()
​
while True:
    msg = mav.recv_match(blocking=True)
    if msg.get_type() == 'HEARTBEAT':
        print("HEARTBEAT from %d: %s" % (msg.get_srcSystem(), msg))
```
​
### Run the example
Run the example with the following commands:
```bash
# Login via SSH
ssh smartap@airlink.local
​
# Make sure that you have the example
# file in your home directory and run it with
python3 heartbeat_example_udp.py
```
Once you run the example above you should expect the following output. This is the Heartbeat message coming from the Flight Controller:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151573808-a67d6995-0eda-448d-8694-6a7b797a1512.png)

If you connect with the Ground Control Station software you will also see the heartbeat coming from the GCS:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151573839-20420550-a635-4297-984d-0e4dba316c7c.png)

Feel free to use these code samples for your custom apps development using SmartAP AIRLink and MAVLink communication protocol.

### Get Video feed
AIRLink provides video feed access via RTSP either locally (127.0.0.1) or remotely (airlink.local). Currently, we support integrated `CSI camera` and `HDMI input` as well as  `cameras over Ethernet`:
```yaml
#
Video feed
Type
Host
Port
Address
1
CSI Camera
RTSP
127.0.0.1 or airlink.local
8554
rtsp://airlink.local:8554/camera/0
2
HDMI Input
RTSP
127.0.0.1 or airlink.local
8554
rtsp://airlink.local:8554/camera/1
3
NextVision Camera
RTSP
127.0.0.1 or airlink.local
8554
rtsp://airlink.local:8554/camera/2
```
To check the video stream using a standard GStreamer pipeline use the following command:
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://airlink.local:8554/camera/0 ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! autovideosink sync=false

## Firmware updates
### SmartAP AIRLink firmware update on the one drone
The firmware update process is simple and automated. When  finds a new firmware in , it asks the user for approval and uploads new firmware to the drone mission computer. Mission computer updates its firmware and the firmware of the flight control computer.
### Drone fleet firmware update
You can see firmware versions and update the firmware of your whole drone fleet or one single part using . After you choose drones, the task scheduler will gradually update the firmware as soon as these drones are connected to the .

## Update autopilot bootloader
In some cases you might need to update the autopilot bootloader to get it to the latest version or to recover the unit.
### Download Bootloader file
First of all, you would need to download the bootloader file and save it on your computer. You can get the most recent bootloader file with the link below:
SmartAP AIRLink Bootloader

### Copy bootloader file on a microSD card of the autopilot
Take the microSD card from your autopilot, plug it into your computer and copy smartap_airlink_bootloader.bin into the foot folder. After that, plug in the microSD card back into the AIRLink FMU microSD card slot.

### Run update procedure
Connect SmartAP AIRLink to your computer using FMU USB port and open Terminal in QGC.
Locate the microsd card folder:
cd fs/microsd
List the files to make sure that there is a required bootloader file:
ls
You would see the following output:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574066-59917a00-ef5e-4fbb-9419-133beee9aa03.png)

Run bootloader update procedure:
bl_update smartap_airlink_bl.bin
You should expect the following output:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574084-2531556d-d9d2-4a7a-a52e-f92aeddd79fc.png)

Autopilot bootloader update has been successfully completed.

## Troubleshooting
### Unable to access airlink.local
Usually AIRLink dashboard is available at  address, however, this is browser and router dependent and not all routers support the technology needed for this (local DNS). If your router does not support the Local DNS technology, then you can find the assigned address on the settings page of your router and access AIRLink with the IP address (this is usually 192.168.1.X).
To identify the IP address you will need to go to your router dashboard, login and find the connected devices list. Usually, it looks as follows:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574132-c0cd119a-1141-4dff-89e8-60b0ec0eda5f.png)

In our case we found our that the IP address of the AIRLink in the home / office network is 192.168.0.19
Therefore, if we go to 192.168.0.19 in the web browser we will see the same welcome page.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574159-b650fc87-278b-4ab1-beb8-a1b73dbb8bf1.png)


## Firmware recovery
Steps to recover the firmware in case something doesn't go right
### Get the firmware
Contact Sky-Drones Technologies using this to get the firmware.

### Prepare microSD card
You will need an empty micro SD card with at least 32GB capacity to flash the firmware image onto it.

### Download and install the flashing tool
Download  software, this will help to prepare the bootable SD card and flash an image onto it. After the download is completed, install the software and open it.

### Flash the image onto SD card
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574314-b396f0ee-2db3-451f-b2b4-5b36aa291303.png)

Select an image file you have just downloaded
Select the Target (your 32 GB SD card)
Make sure that you have selected the correct target which corresponds to the microSD card. Selecting the wrong target will result in the target being overwritten and lost data.
Click Flash!
The process will take approximately 20 minutes. Make sure to safely unmount SD card before unplugging it from the card reader.
### Flash image in AIRLink

1. Insert the SD card into CPU SD card slot
2. Connect the main Power supply to the AIRLink, the system is powered on.

Firmware upgrade process will be started and will include the following key milestones:
1. In approximately 5 minutes, the blue CAM LED will light up. This means that the start of the firmware upgrade process has been successfully initiated.
2. In approximately 15-20 minutes CAM LED will start flashing slowly. This means that the firmware process has been completed and the verification stage is in progress.
3. In approximately 2-5 minutes after the start of CAM LED flashing, the AIRLink will turn itself off automatically. This means that the firmware upgrade process has been successfully completed.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/151574556-d9d111d3-dffd-4c7f-b373-e800f15eeb78.png)

CAM LED Status light (Blue)
After that, you need to turn off the power and remove the microSD card. On the next power up the AIRLink will boot in standard operating mode.
WARNING: DO NOT DISCONNECT THE POWER SUPPLY OF AIRLINK DURING THE UPGRADE PROCESS
Don't forget to remove the microSD card from the slot. Otherwise, the firmware update process will be started again on the next power up.
