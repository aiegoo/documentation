## Installation

Start with a fresh Raspberry image.
Confirmed working images:

!!! warning "Bullseye release"

    Raspberry organisation just released (01.11.2021) new bullseye image wich is not yet compatible with UAVcast.
    Please use the previous buster releases from the links bellow:

- [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip)
- [Raspberry Pi OS With Desktop](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf.zip)


!!! note "Looking for other boards!"
    We are currently building UAVcast-Pro for other architectures and OS.
    [Check out our beta section](/pages/beta/)

See the [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/) for installation instruction. <br>
Continue to install UAVcast-Pro as described in the [installation](/installation/#uavcast-pro-installation) section

##UAVcast-Pro installation


You can install the latest version of UAVcast-Pro by pasting this command into you RPI shell.

```bash
curl -s http://install.uavmatrix.com | sudo bash
```

After the installation there will be validating proccess to verify that all component has been loaded successfully.
You can now access the webinterface using the RPI ip or Host name address in your browser. [http://raspberrypi/](http://raspberrypi/)

### Navio Flight Controller
For Navio+ and Navio2 boards, please use the installation procedure below:

- Install the latest image provided by [https://emlid.com](https://emlid.com).
- Connect to your RPI with SSH and run the **emlidtool** as described in the emlid documentation.[https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/common/ardupilot/installation-and-running/#choosing-a-vehicle-version-and-board](https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/common/ardupilot/installation-and-running/#choosing-a-vehicle-version-and-board)
- Select your vehicle, version and frame.
- **On Boot** Select disable
- **Ardupilot** Select stop
- **Apply** and exit.
- Install UAVcast-Pro as described [uavcast-pro-installation](#uavcast-pro-installation)

  !['emlidtool Example'](images/pages/installation/emlidtool.jpg)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156092894-8e8c51c2-ff5d-44f9-860d-86d36bb70035.png)

## How does it work?
UAVcast-Pro is an application that provides an easier method for streaming mavlink (telemetry) data and video over a defined network.
It will connect to the Flight Controller using mavlink protocol and proxy these packages to a destination of your choice.

The behaviour is exaclty the same as when using regular telemetry module, there is no limitaion using UAVcast-Pro.

UAVcast-Pro will use the default network connection for streaming, and by using uavnet, the connection will also be secure.
Uavnet is a vpn built on the zerotier controller and provides secure peer to peer conectivity.

The application is hosted locally on your device, and there is no communication to a 3rd party!

#<!-- prettier-ignore -->
## Hardware

### TL;DR
You will need a raspbery pi and a mavlink flight controller to get going. You dont need a modem for testing locally in your home network, a local wifi or ethernet connection will work just fine.
As soon as you have configured everything and are ready to go flying, you need a modem, we recommend a HiLink (Plug and Play) type.

If you want to control your drone manually during flight, we also recommend using a USB gamepad connected to Mission Planner joystick integration.

See more info bellow.

##Flight Controllers

All Mavlink based boards are supported (PX4, Ardupilot).

The Ardupilot project is often adding support for other flight controllers.
The full list of supported flight controllers can be viewed here [http://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-autopilots.html](http://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-autopilots.html).

To mention some supported board:

- Pixhawk
- APMx
- Cube
- Matek
- Navio+
- Navio2

### Connection Methods
There is two ways to connect the FC to Raspberry PI, either using USB (preferred) or GPIO
There is no diffrence in performance but the USB connection is easier and more elegant.

####USB

- Connect a micro USB cable between the FC and RPI as shown in the picture bellow.

!!! warning "USB cross-sectional"

    Use a USB cable with large cross-sectional area to minimize the voltage drop supplied to Fligth Controller.

!['Usb'](images/pages/Flight-Controller/rpi-usb.jpg)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156089747-83fa9174-9e09-487f-8a52-a139d883d397.png)

#### GPIO

- Its very imporant to connect tx, rx and ground if you want to use GPIO, and not only tx & rx.

!!! warning

    RPI cannot be powered by FC telem port.  [Make sure you use proper power source for rpi.](/hardware/#power-supply)

!['Gpio'](images/pages/Flight-Controller/rpi.jpg)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156089728-20ad747c-8378-47c0-960a-062f5f6b1dd1.png)

## Supported Raspberry Pi boards

- Pi0w
- PI 2
- Pi 3
- Pi 4

!!! warning "Pi0w"

    Pi0w runs fine with UAVcast-Pro, however the CPU usage will be between 50 > 100%.<br>
    Some functionalities has been disabled to reduce the CPU load!

If you intend to use other programs with UAVcast-Pro then Pi3 or 4 version is recommended.

##Power supply
It's important that Raspberry Pi gets voltage between **4.8 and 5.3v**. If you use LTE modem, make sure you are not overloading the USB port per. design.

Read the modem specification / datasheet and make sure the modem is not consuming more than MAX output defined in the table below.

!!! info "USB Camera"

    If you use USB camera, make sure you include the camera consumption as well.

[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md)

- **Limited by PSU** referes the value from the (Recommended PSU current capacity). Make sure you use a proper power supply that are able to deliver above this value.

  !['pi power table'](images/pages/hardware/pi-power.jpg)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156089785-57339b2a-5d4e-45b0-93bb-05c6c6524701.png)

If you need to add external power, please see instructions bellow.
This is one solution, where we attach the power directly to the USB +/- pins, and one wire to the RPI fuse. The latter will make sure RPI is booting automatically when powered.

!!! note

    Make sure you connect the modem to correct USB port where external power supply is connected.

**HiLink or Stick modems**

Some Huawei USB modems have a mode called "HiLink" which provides for "driverless" installation on Windows, Macintosh and Linux computers. These modems usually have the HiLink logo marked on the outside, or have letter H in the model name. **Example E3372H**. All modems in the table above is HiLink!

Stick modems is a regular modem where you need to send AT commands to establish a cell connection. UAVcast has all the connection stuff you need integrate a stick modem.

**HiLink Advantages**

The big advantages being that the connection time is very fast and hassle free.
A HiLink modem uses a web browser to access the modem settings.

It acts more or less like a plug and play modem, you don't need to configure any parameters in UAVcast-Pro or Raspberry Pi.

**HiLink Disadvantages**

Hilink modems does not support Port Forwarding out of the box. You certainly almost every-time need to flash new firmware to access the Port Forwarding menu in the modem web interface.

However, if you use VPN connection then HiLink is a perfect choice as VPN does't not require any port forwarding.

!!! Info
    If you are connected using VPN, then DNS is not needed. VPN connections uses static IP address that wont change.

Dynamic DNS allow you to bind an external IP address to a convenient name so we humans can easily remember. 
The name (Alias) will always be pointing towards the external IP address even though if the IP changes.

As an example, www.google.com is pointing towards 172.217.21.142, if you type that IP address in your browser you will still access the google.com, but those numbers would be hard to remember, hence the name is more convenient.

Here is a list for UAVcast supported services.
Use any of the bellow services and add the name to the DNS System input.

* For dyndns.org:         default@dyndns.org
* For freedns.afraid.org: default@freedns.afraid.org
* For zoneedit.com:       default@zoneedit.com
* For no-ip.com:          default@no-ip.com
* For easydns.com:        default@easydns.com
* For tzo.com:            default@tzo.com
* For 3322.org:           dyndns@3322.org
* For dnsomatic.com:      default@dnsomatic.com
* For tunnelbroker.net:   ipv6tb@he.net
* For dns.he.net:         dyndns@he.net
* For dynsip.org:         default@dynsip.org
* For sitelutions.com:    default@sitelutions.com
* For dnsexit.com:        default@dnsexit.com
* For generic:            custom@http_svr_basic_auth

### Username

UAVcast-Pro uses the well known media-handling library gstreamer to proccess the video pipeline towards the Ground Control Station.
It supports PiCam, Logitech C615, Logitech C920 out of the box.

!!! info

    Remember to activate camera in Raspberry Config if you are using PiCam.

    `sudo raspi-config`
    ![raspi-config](../../images/pages/Camera/raspi-config.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156095609-d81bc803-3d44-4484-88f5-533f27ee43e6.png)

#### Camera Type

- Options: `PiCam HTTP, PiCam TCP/UDP, C615, C920, Custom Pipeline`

Each camera uses different start code, also known as pipeline to be able to communicate or process the video source.
UAVcast-Pro has three diffrent cameras pre-defined from the dropdown menu. However, if your camera is not listed then you can insert a **custom pipline** with the [needed plugins](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins.html) to match your current camera model and type.

You can also send a test video by inserting the pipeline below to UAVcast-Pro custom field section, nice way to check if everything is working without the camera itself.

Remember to change the Destination address:  
`gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! x264enc ! video/x-h264, stream-format=byte-stream ! rtph264pay ! udpsink host=GCS_ADDRESS port=5600`

Take a look at this page for pipeline examples
[http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet](http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet)

#### UDP / TCP / HTTP protocol

- Default value: `UDP`

UAVcast-Pro supports UDP, TCP and [HTTP live in-browser viewer for PiCam](/pages/camera/HTTP Videostream), other cameras only support UDP at the moment.
Multiple users may view live video using the HTTP protocol.

#### GCS Destination

All destinations you have added in [Ground Control](../Ground-Control.md) page will be shown in the dropdown list.
It is only possible to select one destination for video.

#### Video resolution

- Default value: `240p (320x240)`
- Options: `240p (320x240), 480p (720x480), 540p (960x540), HD (1280x720), Full HD (1920x1080)`

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the resolution to get smooth video.

#### Destination Port

- Default value: `5600`

Change the Video network port. **Mission Planner** and **QGroundControl** supports video in HUD by default on port 5600.

#### Bitrate

- Default value: `2000000`

Change the Bitrate value.

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the Bitrate to get smooth video.

    Example: `800000`

#### Frames Pr.second

- Default value: `20`

Change the FPS value.

!!! tip

    If your broadband connection has a low transfer speed, then lower the FPS to get smooth video.

    Example: `8`

##Receive **UDP** video (Windows / Mac / Linux / Android)

### Ubuntu

If you're going to stream to a Ubuntu PC, install the some packages locally beforehand.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
```

### Android

- Download and install [QGroundControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mavlink.qgroundcontrol) for Android.

- Find IP address of your device in preferences. You'll need it in order to connect to the phone from your RPi.

- Run QGroundControl and it will automatically detect your vehicle.

_Note: default port for video in QGC application is 5600_

Here's the app in action
![capture](../../images/pages/Camera/qgc.jpg)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42961200/156095786-c6401739-9c46-4c94-b829-281f0982f1ac.png)

### Mac OS X

The simplest way is to use brew. To install it run the following in your Mac terminal:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install gstreamer gst-libav gst-plugins-ugly gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-good
```

### Windows

##### Solution #1

Download and install [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html) or [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/)
both applications supports **UDP** video by default on port 5600 without any extra configuration. Start camera in UAVcast-Pro and open MP or QGC

!!! warning "Streaming over VPN may cause poor video quality in MP and QGC"

    If you experience issues when streaming by VPN, such as **pixalating frames** or **grey overlay** then change the gstreamer source in Mission Planner HUD, with this pipeline:

    ```
    udpsrc port=5601 caps = "application/x-rtp, media=video, clock-rate=90000, encoding-name=H264, payload=96" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGRA ! appsink name=outsink
    ```

    **NOTE!**

    Mission Planner always starts its default gstreamer pipeline and listen on default port 5600, when using the custom source above we need to use a diffrent port so it wont make any conflicts. In this example we use **port 5601**. Remember set port [5601](http://docs.uavmatrix.com/pages/Camera/#destination-port) in UAVcast-Pro as well!

##### Solution #2

Download and install [gstreamer for Windows](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/1.4.5/gstreamer-1.0-x86_64-1.4.5.msi).

Open a new command-prompt window and navigate to the gstreamer bin folder, usually `C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86_64\bin`

#### Start gstreamer For Windows/Ubuntu/Mac OS X:

Paste this gstreamer command in the command-prompt(windows) or terminal (unix/mac) to start gstreamer.

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=5600 caps="application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264" ! rtpjitterbuffer ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false
```

From now on, your computer will be waiting for the input stream from Raspberry PI. Once it gets a stream, you'll see the real-time video from your drone. 

### **TCP** video (Windows / Mac / Linux)

Select TCP from the dropdown menu in UAVcast-Pro web interface. Add your raspberry IP address (if you use Zerotier VPN, add ZT IP address) in the **TCP Host** input box.

Press Start camera button.
You should see **_video started successfully_**

Install gstreamer for your operating system (see above section), then open a new command-prompt(windows) or terminal(unix/mac)

Paste this gstreamer command in the command-prompt(windows) or terminal (unix/mac) to start gstreamer.

!!! info

    Windows users needs to navigate to gstreamer folder before using the below gstreamer command.

You need to change the **PI_IP** to the same as you used for **TCP Host**

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -v tcpclientsrc host=PI_IP port=5600 ! gdpdepay ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink sync=false
```

From now on, your computer will be connecting towards Raspberry PI. Once it gets a stream, you'll see the real-time video from your drone.

### Startup help files (Windows)
It's possible to save the gstreamer pipline to a .cmd file, then you can just double click the file and video will start automatically.

Download files below, then right click and select _edit_. Change the port number or path of gstreamer if necessary.

## FAQ

### Do i need a LTE modem?
No. UAVcast-Pro does not care if you use LTE, Wifi or Ethernet cable. As long as the application is able to communicate with the Ground Control station over TCP/IP stack, it will work.

### Not able to open web interface

- Make sure you use latest raspberry image. Older version might be incompatible.
- You can type `journalctl -u UAVcast-Web.service --since yesterday` in the rpi console to get more debug information.

### Where can i download latest version?

- See the [installation](/installation/#uavcast-pro-installation) instructions

### Cannot activate UAVcast-Pro license

- Make sure you have proper internet connection for your RPI. During the validation, RPI needs to contact uavmatrix.com license server for validation.

### Installation validation fails.

- Make sure you use a supported raspberry image as decribed in the [installation instructions](/installation/#raspberry-pi-image).
- For other installation issues, please navigate to `UAVcast-Pro/install` folder and copy the `Installation.log` to your computer.
  Create a new discussion in our forum [discuss.uavmatrix.com](https://discuss.uavmatrix.com) and attach the file.

### Im not able to receive video or telemetry

- Make sure you have added video and telemetry port to your firewall rules.
- If you have changed the default ports for video 5600 or telemetry 14550 you need to change this on your ground control station device as well.
- Connect your FC to your computer and connect with Mission Planner. Goto all paramters list and search for the connection port used to Raspberry Pi. Serial0 (USB). Serial1 (Telem1 port), Serial2 (Telem2 port). Take note of the Mavlink Protocol (1 or 2) used, as well as the Baud rate. Make sure you use the same settings in UAVcast-Pro Flight Controller page. 

### No Mavlink Heartbeats received in UAVcast-Pro

- Make sure the configuration in UAVcast-Pro Flight Controller page reflects the settings in the Flight Controller. You can see the FC setttings using Mission Planner => All parameters list => search for Serial0 (USB) or Serial1 (Telem1 port) or Serial2 (Telem2)
- Make sure you are using a good USB cable with large cross-sectional area to minimize the voltage drop supplied to Fligth Controller.
- If you are connected by GPIO pins, make sure you have connected the **ground, rx, tx** wires correctly.
- Make sure you use default configuration in Flight Controller (Ardupilot, Px4) for UART / Telemetry ports.

### Cant receive video, but telemetry works

- [PiCam] Please make sure you have enabled PiCam in the Raspberry config **raspi-config**
- [Logitech cams] Check logfiles and see if there is any errors. If you see **Internal data stream error** its most likey a unsupported resoultion or fps. Try play with those settings.

### Other Application issues.

- If you experience any issues with UAVcast running on your Raspberry, please Navigate to the UAVcast page and
  press "Download Logfiles" button. This will download a zip file containing all logs related to UAVcast and its running components.
  Log content will only contain application data and not user data.

      Create a new discussion in our forum [discuss.uavmatrix.com](https://discuss.uavmatrix.com) and attach the zip file, or mail it to our support department support@uavmatrix.com
