## pilotpi-rpios

### PilotPi with Raspberry Pi OS

## Developer Quick Start

### OS Image

The latest official [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf_latest) image is always recommended.
<!--more-->

To install you must already have a working SSH connection to RPi.

### Setting up Access (Optional)

#### Hostname and mDNS

mDNS helps you connect to your RasPi with hostname instead of IP address.

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

Navigate to **Network Options > Hostname**.
Set and exit.
You may want to setup [passwordless auth](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) as well. 

### Setting up OS

#### config.txt

```sh
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Replace the file with:

```sh
# enable sc16is752 overlay
dtoverlay=sc16is752-spi1
# enable I2C-1 and set the frequency to 400KHz
dtparam=i2#c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
# enable spidev0.0
dtparam=spi=on
# enable RC input
enable_uart=1
# enable I2C-0
dtparam=i2c_vc=on
# switch Bluetooth to miniuart
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
```

#### cmdline.txt

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

**Interfacing Options > Serial > login shell = No > hardware = Yes**.
Enable UART but without a login shell on it.

```sh
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```#

Append `isolcpus=2` after the last word.
The whole file would be:

```sh
console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=xxxxxxxx-xx rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait isolcpus=2
```

This tells the Linux kernel not to schedule any process on CPU core 2.
We will manually run PX4 onto that core later.

Reboot and SSH onto your RasPi.

Check UART interface:

```sh
ls /dev/tty*
```

There should be `/dev/ttyAMA0`, `/dev/ttySC0` and `/dev/ttySC1`.

Check I2C interface:

```sh
ls /dev/i2c*
```

There should be `/dev/i2c-0` and `/dev/i2c-1`

Check SPI interface

```sh
ls /dev/spidev*
```

There should be `/dev/spidev0.0`.

#### rc.local

In this section we will configure the auto-start script in **rc.local**.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Append below content to the file above `exit 0`:

```sh
echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/direction
if [ $(cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/value) -eq 1 ] ; then
        echo "Launching PX4"
        cd /home/pi/px4 ; nohup taskset -c 2 ./bin/px4 -d -s pilotpi_mc.config 2 &> 1 > /home/pi/px4/px4.log &
fi
echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport
```

Save and exit.

:::note
Don't forget to turn off the switch when it is not needed.
:::

#### CSI camera

:::note
Enable CSI camera will stop anything works on I2C-0.
:::

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

**Interfacing Options > Camera**

### Building the code

To get the *very latest* version onto your computer, enter the following command into a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

:::note
This is all you need to do just to build the latest code. 
:::

#### Cross build for Raspberry Pi OS

Set the IP (or hostname) of your RPi using:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X
```

or

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=pi_hostname.local
```

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd PX4-Autopilot
make scumaker_pilotpi_default
```

Then upload it with:

```sh
make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload
```

Connect over ssh and run it with:

```sh
cd px4
sudo taskset -c 2 ./bin/px4 -s pilotpi_mc.config
```

Now PX4 is started with multi-rotor configuration.

If you encountered the similar problem executing `bin/px4` on your Pi as following:

```
bin/px4: /lib/xxxx/xxxx: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by bin/px4)
```

Then you should compile with docker instead.

Before proceeding to next step, clear the existing building at first:

```sh
rm -rf build/scumaker_pilotpi_default
```

### Alternative build method (using docker)

The following method can provide the same tool-sets deployed in CI.

If you are compiling for the first time with docker, please refer to the [offical docs](../test_and_ci/docker.md#prerequisites).

Execute the command in PX4-Autopilot folder:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X; export NO_NINJA_BUILD=1; make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload"
```

:::note
mDNS is not supported within docker. You must specify the correct IP address every time when uploading.
:::

:::note
If your IDE doesn't support ninja build, `NO_NINJA_BUILD=1` option will help.
You can compile without uploading too. Just remove `upload` target.
:::

It is also possible to just compile the code with command:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "make scumaker_pilotpi_default"
```

### Post-configuration

You need to check these extra items to get your vehicle work properly.

#### Mixer file

Mixer file is defined in `pilotpi_xx.conf`:

```sh
mixer load /dev/pwm_output0 etc/mixers/quad_x.main.mix
```

All available mixers are stored in `etc/mixers`. You can create one by yourself as well.

#### External compass

In the startup script(`*.config`), you will find

```sh
# external GPS & compass
gps start -d /dev/ttySC0 -i uart -p ubx -s
#hmc5883 start -X
#ist8310 start -X
```

Uncomment the correct one for your case.
Not sure which compass comes up with your GPS module? Execute the following commands and see the output:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
i2cdetect -y 0
```

Sample output:

```
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 0e -- 
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1e -- 
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

`1e` indicates a HMC5883 based compass is mounted on external I2C bus. Similarly, IST8310 has a value of `0e`.

:::note
Generally you only have one of them.
Other devices will also be displayed here if they are connected to external I2C bus.(`/dev/i2c-0`)

## Raspberry Pi 2/3 Navio2 Autopilot

:::warning
PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot.
Contact the [manufacturer](https://emlid.com/) for hardware support or compliance issues.
:::
<!--more-->

:::warning
PX4 support for this flight controller is [experimental](../flight_controller/autopilot_experimental.md).
:::

This is the developer "quickstart" for Raspberry Pi 2/3 Navio2 autopilots.
It allows you to build PX4 and transfer to the RasPi, or build natively.

![Ra Pi Image](images/drones/hardware/hardware-rpi2.jpg)


### OS Image

Use the [Emlid RT Raspbian image for Navio 2](https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/configuring-raspberry-pi).
The default image will have most of the setup procedures shown below already done.

:::warning
Make sure not to upgrade the system (more specifically the kernel).
By upgrading, a new kernel can get installed which lacks the necessary HW support (you can check with `ls /sys/class/pwm`, the directory should not be empty).
:::

### Setting up Access

The Raspbian image has SSH setup already.
Username is "pi" and password is "raspberry".
You can connect to your RPi2/3 over a network (Ethernet is set to come up with DHCP by default) and then proceed to configure WiFi access.
We assume that the username and password remain at their defaults for the purpose of this guide.

To setup the RPi2/3 to join your local wifi, follow [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md).

Find the IP address of your Pi from your network, and then you can proceed to connect to it using SSH.

```sh
ssh pi@<IP-ADDRESS>
```

## Expand the Filesystem

After installing the OS and connecting to it, make sure to [expand the Filesystem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md), so there is enough space on the SD Card.

## Disable Navio RGB Overlay

The existing Navio RGB overlay claims GPIOs used by PX4 for RGB Led.
Edit `/boot/config.txt` by commenting the line enabling the `navio-rgb` overlay.
```
#dtoverlay=navio-rgb
```

## Changing Hostnames

To avoid conflicts with any other RPis on the network, we advise you to change the default hostname to something sensible.
We used "px4autopilot" for our setup.
Connect to the Pi via SSH and follow the below instructions.

Edit the hostname file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

Change `raspberry` to whatever hostname you want (one word with limited characters apply)

Next you need to change the hosts file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Change the entry `127.0.1.1 raspberry` to `127.0.1.1 <YOURNEWHOSTNAME>`

Reboot the Pi after this step is completed to allow it to re-associate with your network.

## Setting up Avahi (Zeroconf)

To make connecting to the Pi easier, we recommend setting up Avahi (Zeroconf) which allows easy access to the Pi from any network by directly specifying its hostname.
# PilotPi with Ubuntu Server

:::warning
Ubuntu Server on RPi 4B consumes a lot of current and generates a lot of heat.
Design for better heat dissipation and high power consumption when using this hardware.

#### Latest OS

Please refer to official [cdimage](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/) page for any new updates.

### First boot

When setting up RaPi's WiFi for the first time we recommended using a wired Ethernet connection between your home router and RPi, and a monitor and keyboard.

#### Before booting

Mount the SD card onto your computer and modify the network settings.
Please follow the official instruction [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#3-wifi-or-ethernet).

Now plug the SD card onto your Pi and boot for the first time.
Make sure you have shell access to the RPi - either SSH connection over wired Ethernet, or direct accessing with keyboard and monitor.

#### WiFi region

First install required package:

```sh
sudo apt-get install crda
```

Edit the file `/etc/default/crda` to change the correct WiFi region. [Reference List](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/InstantWenger_Mobile/Advanced/Content/Instant%20User%20Guide%20-%20volumes/Country_Codes_List.htm)

```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/crda
```

Then your Pi will able to join your WiFi network after reboot.

#### Hostname and mDNS

Let's set up hostname at first.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

Change the hostname to whatever you like.
Then install the package required by mDNS:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
```

Perform a reboot.
raspi
```sh
sudo reboot
```

Regain the accessibility through WiFi connection after the above operation.

```sh
ssh ubuntu@pi_hostname.local
```

#### Password-less Auth (Optional)

You may want to setup [passwordless auth](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) as well. 

### Setting up OS

#### config.txt

The corresponding file in Ubuntu is `/boot/firmware/usercfg.txt`.

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt
```

Replace the file with:

```sh
# enable sc16is752 overlay
dtoverlay=sc16is752-spi1
# enable I2C-1 and set the frequency to 400KHz
dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
# enable spidev0.0
dtparam=spi=on
# enable RC input
enable_uart=1
# enable I2C-0
dtparam=i2c_vc=on
# switch Bluetooth to miniuart
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
```

#### cmdline.txt

On Ubuntu Server 20.04:

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

On Ubuntu Server 18.04 or earlier, `nobtcmd.txt` and `btcmd.txt` should both be modified.

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/nobtcmd.txt
```

Find `console=/dev/ttyAMA0,115200` and remove that part to disable the login shell on serial interface.

Append `isolcpus=2` after the last word.
The whole file will then look like:

```sh
net.ifnames=0 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=LABEL=writable rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fixrtc isolcpus=2
```

The above line tells the Linux kernel do not schedule any process on CPU core 2.
We will manually run PX4 onto that core later.

Reboot and SSH onto your Pi.

Check UART interface:

```sh
ls /dev/tty*
```

There should be `/dev/ttyAMA0`, `/dev/ttySC0` and `/dev/ttySC1`.

Check I2C interface:

```sh
ls /dev/i2c*
```

There should be `/dev/i2c-0` and `/dev/i2c-1`

Check SPI interface:

```sh
ls /dev/spidev*
```

There should be `/dev/spidev0.0`.

#### rc.local

In this section we will configure the auto-start script in **rc.local**.
Note that we need to create this file, as it is not present on a fresh Ubuntu OS.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Append the content below to the file:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/direction
if [ $(cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/value) -eq 1 ] ; then
        echo "Launching PX4"
        cd /home/ubuntu/px4 ; nohup taskset -c 2 ./bin/px4 -d -s pilotpi_mc.config 2 &> 1 >raspi
echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport

exit 0
```

Save and exit.
Then set the correct permissions:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

:::note
Don't forget to turn off the switch when it is not needed!
:::

#### CSI camera

:::warning
Enable CSI camera will stop anything works on I2C-0.
:::

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt
```

Append the following line at the end of file:

```sh
start_x=1
```

### Building the code

To get the *very latest* version onto your computer, enter the following command into a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

:::note
This is all you need to do just to build the latest code. 
:::

#### Set RPi upload target

Set the IP (or hostname) of your RPi using:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X
```

or

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=pi_hostname.local
```

Additionally, we need to set the username:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu
```

#### Build for armhf target

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd Firmware
make scumaker_pilotpi_default
```

Then upload it with:

```sh
make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload
```

#### Alternative build method for armhf (using docker)

If you are compiling for the first time with docker, please refer to the [offical docs](../test_and_ci/docker.md#prerequisites).

Execute the command in firmware folder:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X; export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu; export NO_NINJA_BUILD=1; make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload"
```

:::note
mDNS is not supported within docker. You must specify the correct IP address every time when uploading.
:::

:::note
If your IDE doesn't support ninja build, `NO_NINJA_BUILD=1` option will help.
You can compile without uploading too. Just remove `upload` target.
:::

It is also possible to just compile the code with command:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "make scumaker_pilotpi_default"
```

#### Build for arm64 target

:::note
This step requires `aarch64-linux-gnu` tool-chain to be installed.
:::

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd PX4-Autopilot
make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64
```

Then upload it with:

```sh
make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64 upload
```

#### Alternative build method for arm64 (using docker)

If you are compiling for the first time with docker, please refer to the [offical docs](../test_and_ci/docker.md#prerequisites).

Execute the command in `PX4-Autopilot` folder:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X; export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu; export NO_NINJA_BUILD=1; make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64 upload"
```

:::note

:::

It is also possible to just compile the code with command:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64"
```

#### Manually run PX4

Connect over SSH and run it with:

```sh
cd px4
sudo taskset -c 2 ./bin/px4 -s pilotpi_mc.config
```

Now PX4 is started with multi-rotor configuration.

If you encountered the similar problem executing `bin/px4` on your Pi as following:

```
bin/px4: /lib/xxxx/xxxx: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by bin/px4)
```

Then you should compile with docker instead.

Before proceeding to next step, clear the existing building at first:
raspi
```sh
rm -rf build/scumaker_pilotpi_*
```

Then go back to the corresponding chapter above.

### Post-configuration

Please refer to the instructions [here](raspberry_pi_pilotpi_rpios.md)

```sh
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
sudo insserv avahi-daemon
```
Next, setup the Avahi configuration file

```sh
sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service
```
Add this to the file :

```xml

```

Change the hostname to whatever you like.
Then install the package required by mDNS:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
```

Perform a reboot.
raspi
```sh
sudo reboot
```

Regain the accessibility through WiFi connection after the above operation.

```sh
ssh ubuntu@pi_hostname.local
```

#### Password-less Auth (Optional)

You may want to setup [passwordless auth](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) as well. 

### Setting up OS

#### config.txt

The corresponding file in Ubuntu is `/boot/firmware/usercfg.txt`.

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt
```

Replace the file with:

```sh
# enable sc16is752 overlay
dtoverlay=sc16is752-spi1
# enable I2C-1 and set the frequency to 400KHz
dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
# enable spidev0.0

```

#### cmdline.txt

On Ubuntu Server 20.04:

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

On Ubuntu Server 18.04 or earlier, `nobtcmd.txt` and `btcmd.txt` should both be modified.

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/nobtcmd.txt
```

Find `console=/dev/ttyAMA0,115200` and remove that part to disable the login shell on serial interface.

Append `isolcpus=2` after the last word.
The whole file will then look like:

```sh
net.ifnames=0 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=LABEL=writable rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fixrtc isolcpus=2
```

The above line tells the Linux kernel do not schedule any process on CPU core 2.
We will manually run PX4 onto that core later.

Reboot and SSH onto your Pi.

Check UART interface:

```sh
ls /dev/tty*
```

There should be `/dev/ttyAMA0`, `/dev/ttySC0` and `/dev/ttySC1`.

Check I2C interface:

```sh
ls /dev/i2c*
```

There should be `/dev/i2c-0` and `/dev/i2c-1`

Check SPI interface:

```sh
ls /dev/spidev*
```

There should be `/dev/spidev0.0`.

#### rc.local

In this section we will configure the auto-start script in **rc.local**.
Note that we need to create this file, as it is not present on a fresh Ubuntu OS.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Append the content below to the file:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/direction
if [ $(cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio25/value) -eq 1 ] ; then

echo "25" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport

exit 0
```

Save and exit.
Then set the correct permissions:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

#### CSI camera

:::warning
Enable CSI camera will stop anything works on I2C-0.
:::

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt
```

Append the following line at the end of file:

```sh
start_x=1
```

### Building the code

To get the *very latest* version onto your computer, enter the following command into a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```

:::note
This is all you need to do just to build the latest code. 
:::

#### Set RPi upload target

Set the IP (or hostname) of your RPi using:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X
```

or

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=pi_hostname.local
```

Additionally, we need to set the username:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu
```

#### Build for armhf target

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd Firmware
make scumaker_pilotpi_default
```

Then upload it with:

```sh
make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload
```

#### Alternative build method for armhf (using docker)

If you are compiling for the first time with docker, please refer to the [offical docs](../test_and_ci/docker.md#prerequisites).

Execute the command in firmware folder:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X; export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu; export NO_NINJA_BUILD=1; make scumaker_pilotpi_default upload"
```

:::note
mDNS is not supported within docker. You must specify the correct IP address every time when uploading.
:::

:::note
If your IDE doesn't support ninja build, `NO_NINJA_BUILD=1` option will help.
You can compile without uploading too. Just remove `upload` target.
:::

It is also possible to just compile the code with command:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "make scumaker_pilotpi_default"
```

#### Build for arm64 target

:::note
This step requires `aarch64-linux-gnu` tool-chain to be installed.
:::

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd PX4-Autopilot
make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64
```

Then upload it with:

```sh
make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64 upload
```

#### Alternative build method for arm64 (using docker)

If you are compiling for the first time with docker, please refer to the [offical docs](../test_and_ci/docker.md#prerequisites).

Execute the command in `PX4-Autopilot` folder:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X; export AUTOPILOT_USER=ubuntu; export NO_NINJA_BUILD=1; make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64 upload"
```

:::note

:::

It is also possible to just compile the code with command:

```sh
./Tools/docker_run.sh "make scumaker_pilotpi_arm64"
```

#### Manually run PX4

Connect over SSH and run it with:

```sh
cd px4
sudo taskset -c 2 ./bin/px4 -s pilotpi_mc.config
```

Now PX4 is started with multi-rotor configuration.

If you encountered the similar problem executing `bin/px4` on your Pi as following:

```
bin/px4: /lib/xxxx/xxxx: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by bin/px4)
```

Then you should compile with docker instead.

Before proceeding to next step, clear the existing building at first:
raspi
```sh
rm -rf build/scumaker_pilotpi_*
```

Then go back to the corresponding chapter above.

### Post-configuration

Please refer to the instructions [here](raspberry_pi_pilotpi_rpios.md)

        <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
        <service>
                <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
                <port>0</port>
                <txt-record>model=RackMac</txt-record>
        </service>
        <service>
                <type>_ssh._tcp</type>
                <port>22</port>
        </service>
</service-group>

```
Restart the daemon

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart
```
And that's it.
You should be able to access your Pi directly by its hostname from any computer on the network.

:::tip
You might have to add .local to the hostname to discover it.

## Configuring a SSH Public-Key

In order to allow the PX4 development environment to automatically push executables to your board, you need to configure passwordless access to the RPi. 
We use the public-key authentication method for this.

To generate new SSH keys enter the following commands (Choose a sensible hostname such as `<YOURNANME>@<YOURDEVICE>`.  Here we have used `pi@px4autopilot`)

These commands need to be run on the HOST development computer!

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C pi@px4autopilot
```
Upon entering this command, you'll be asked where to save the key. We suggest you save it in the default location ($HOME/.ssh/id_rsa) by just hitting Enter.

Now you should see the files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in your `.ssh` directory in your home folder:

```sh
ls ~/.ssh
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```
The `id_rsa` file is your private key. Keep this on the development computer.
The `id_rsa.pub` file is your public key. This is what you put on the targets you want to connect to.

To copy your public key to your Raspberry Pi, use the following command to append the public key to your authorized_keys file on the Pi, sending it over SSH:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@px4autopilot 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
```

Note that this time you will have to authenticate with your password ("raspberry" by default).

Now try `ssh pi@px4autopilot` and you should connect without a password prompt.

If you see a message "`Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.`" then add your RSA or DSA identities to the authentication agent, ssh-agent and the execute the following command:

```sh
ssh-add
```
If this did not work, delete your keys with `rm ~/.ssh/id*` and follow the instructions again.

## Testing file transfer
We use SCP to transfer files from the development computer to the target board over a network (WiFi or Ethernet).

To test your setup, try pushing a file from the development PC to the Pi over the network now.
Make sure the Pi has network access, and you can SSH into it.

```sh
echo "Hello" > hello.txt
scp hello.txt pi@px4autopilot:/home/pi/
rm hello.txt
```
This should copy over a "hello.txt" file into the home folder of your RPi.
Validate that the file was indeed copied, and you can proceed to the next step.


## Building the Code

Either build the source code on your development computer ("cross-compiler" build) or build it on the RaPi ("native" build) as shown below.


### Cross-compiler Build

First install the [standard developer environment on your Ubunto development computer](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux.md).

Set the IP (or hostname) of your RPi using:

```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=192.168.X.X
```
or
```sh
export AUTOPILOT_HOST=pi_hostname.domain
```

:::note
The value of the environment variable should be set before the build, or `make upload` will fail to find your RPi.
:::

Build the executable file:

```sh
cd PX4-Autopilot
make emlid_navio2 # for cross-compiler build
```

The "px4" executable file is in the directory **build/emlid_navio2_default/**.
Make sure you can connect to your RPi over ssh, see [instructions how to access your RPi](#setting-up-access).

Then upload it with:

```sh
cd PX4-Autopilot
make emlid_navio2 upload # for cross-compiler build
```

Then, connect over ssh and run it with (as root):

```sh
cd ~/px4
sudo ./bin/px4 -s px4.config
```

### Native Build

A native build is one that you run directly on the Pi (the other option is to run builds on a development computer which cross-compiles for the Pi, and pushes the PX4 executable binary directly to the Pi).

Run these commands on the Pi to setup the build system on the Pi.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake python-empy
```

Clone the Firmware directly onto the Pi then build the native build target (`emlid_navio2_native`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
cd PX4-Autopilot
make emlid_navio2_native
```

The "px4" executable file is in the directory **build/emlid_navio2_native/**.
Run it directly with:

```sh
sudo ./build/emlid_navio2_native/px4 build/emlid_navio2_native/etc -s ./posix-configs/rpi/px4.config
```

A successful build followed by executing px4 will give you something like this:

```sh

______  __   __    ___
| ___ \ \ \ / /   /   |
| |_/ /  \ V /   / /| |
|  __/   /   \  / /_| |
| |     / /^\ \ \___  |
\_|     \/   \/     |_/

px4 starting.


pxh>
```

## Autostart

To autostart px4, add the following to the file **/etc/rc.local** (adjust it accordingly if you use native build), right before the `exit 0` line:
```sh
cd /home/pi && ./bin/px4 -d -s px4.config > px4.log
```
