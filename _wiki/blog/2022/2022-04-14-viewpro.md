#### usb to ttl cable

Connect the camera to the upper computer by USB to TTL cable
(Adopt connection method of TX to RX, RX to TX, GNG to GND at
Dupont ends of the provided USB to TTL cable, connect to the
specified TTL of the gimbal, and the USB end of the cable connect to
computer).

#### S.Bust control
Control the gimbal camera functions by one combining signals.
Connect the external S.Bus to S.Bus port on the control box, and the
external S.bus signal GND connect to the GND interface of the control
box.
Wiring Diagram (Take Futaba remote control for example):
Install Viewlink control software to test the functions directly. Users
may choose to develop their own software, please contact technical
support for TTL control protocol file.
ViewLink is a user interface developed by Viewpro for Viewpro gimbal
cameras, you can download it from Viewpro website (www.viewprotech.com) or ask distributors for installation package.

S.Bus control mode: default S.Bus signal channel 9-15 to control
gimbal camera functions (the function of channel is consistent with
corresponding channel in PWM function description)
 TTL control and S.bus control cannot coexist at the
same time for standard version. The default control is
TTL if no requirement. The user can set to S.bus control
if needed (please contact with our technical support for
the setting instruction.)
 User can set the channels by setting serial command
according to the actual requirement. The S.Bus channel
position can be arranged in any sequence within
channel 1-15 to connect with the flight controller or
remote control.
```
Channel 9: Yaw Control
Channel 10: Pitch Control
Channel 11: Mode Control
Channel 12: Zoom Control
Channel 13: Focus Control
Channel 14: Pic/Rec Control
Channel 15: Multi Backup
```

#### TCP Control
For Viewpro gimbal cameras with Ethernet output, the default IP
address is: 192.168.2.119, control port: 2000. You can send the
corresponding protocol to realize TCP control after connecting.
The TCP control protocol is [Frame header: EB + command ID: 90 +
data body (serial port protocol) + Checksum (CS = body checksum,
checksum is calculated as a sum of all bytes of data body modulo
256)]. Or directly use UI Viewlink to control after TCP connection.
