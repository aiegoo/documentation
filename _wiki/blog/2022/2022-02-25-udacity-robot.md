```cplus
00:00
Robots perceive the world around them through the use of sensors.
00:04
You can think of robot sensors as analogous to
00:07
our human senses like sight, hearing, and touch.
00:12
There are many different types of sensors used in robotics.
00:16
Robots eyes might be analogous to cameras,
00:19
lidar, radar, or even ultrasound.
00:23
A microphone could be a robot's ears.
00:27
Giving a robot a sense of touch might be
00:29
achieved through the use of temperature or pressure sensors.
00:33
Even senses like taste and smell can be achieved using chemical analyzers.
00:39
Robots can also be equipped with sensors that have
00:42
no human analogue like GPS to establish exact position on earth,
00:47
a barometer to track altitude,
00:49
or even a magnetic field sensor with actinic.
00:52
In this program, you will gain experience with
00:55
a wide range of sensor modalities and sensor data.
