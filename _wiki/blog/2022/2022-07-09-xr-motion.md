This article shows some of the requirements for Face Tracking and features available in ARKit3:

https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/04/arkit-3-device-support/

"People Occlusion and the use of motion capture, simultaneous front and back camera, and multiple face tracking are supported on devices with A12/A12X Bionic chips, ANE, and TrueDepth Camera."

ARKit 3 goes further than ever before, naturally showing AR content in front of or behind people using People Occlusion, tracking up to three faces at a time, supporting collaborative sessions, and more. And now, you can take advantage of ARKit’s new awareness of people to integrate human movement into your app.
