## Digital Ocean
### DO Images
> Projects
1. gitlab for self-managed version control server and voip/asterisk
2. mosa devOps for deep learning and other linux platform development

With these two projects, I ran several droplets while in the peakest, and two images are managed as snapshots; jdlab-feb2022 and centos-freepbx
