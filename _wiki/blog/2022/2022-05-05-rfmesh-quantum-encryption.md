## post-jdlab research

-- first of all, I didn't sign any NDA with any of the parties involved. All the data and documents were provided without any reservation or any warnings, verbal/written or any means of uderlying messages, which makes this past project with my former employer something I feel free to discuss and use to my advantage.

> key elements

- RF mesh to relay wifi signals that carries encryption over a long-distance. 
- Quantum board to encrypt and decrypt IMU sensor and video data.
- Network setup
- Cable and wire customization
- Control page to whitelist devices and host/air nodes
- Debugging and network
