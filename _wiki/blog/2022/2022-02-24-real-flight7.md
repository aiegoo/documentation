The lift formula is rearranged to determine speed as a function of wing loading and the lift coefficient. If we assume that the lift coefficient is approximately constant between the two aircraft during cruise (this is an acceptable assumption here to demonstrate the concept of wing loading), then we can compare the effect that wing loading has on the resulting cruise speed.

An increased wing loading corresponds to a smaller wing at a given mass, and results in an increased cruise speed. Of course the Legacy has a much larger engine which allows it to reach a far higher cruise speed (drag is proportional to V^2), but the point still stands that an aircraft that is designed to cruise at higher speeds will do so most efficiently with a higher wing loading. The highly loaded wing also results in a higher stall speed (clean), and a more complicated flap arrangement (greater increase in lift coefficient) is thus required to reduce the stall speed.

***wing-area***

Lift is an aerodynamic force which is produced as a consequence of the curvature of the wing and the angle of attack of the relative velocity flowing over the surface. It follows that larger wings of a greater planform area are able to produce more lift; this is easily shown mathematically from the lift formula:

- control surface

The flaps and ailerons are attached to a rear spar which runs along the span. The spar is designed to resist and transfer the loads generated by the deflection of the control surfaces.

Trailing edge flaps are one of two devices used to extract additional lift from a wing at low speed. Slats modify the camber at the leading edge, performing a similar roll to the flaps. High-lift devices are a large topic on their own and are discussed in detail in Part 4 of this mini-series.

The total lift force is increased in proportion with the wing area.
