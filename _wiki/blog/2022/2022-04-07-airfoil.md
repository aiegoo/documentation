airplane the lattice like wing is
1:30
covered with a thin sheet of polymer and
1:32
has a density of just 3.8 pounds per
1:35
cubic foot 5.6 kilograms per cubic meter
1:40
but lightness isn't the only advantage
1:43
of the new wing design it's also
1:45
flexible by strategically placing stiff
1:49
and flexible components in the lattice

1:07
thing called a macro fiber composite
1:09
actuator big word it's basically a piezo
1:12
electric composite that means that the
1:14
structure and the actuation device are
1:17
all one thing so there's no mechanism
1:19
like there isn't a traditional airplane
