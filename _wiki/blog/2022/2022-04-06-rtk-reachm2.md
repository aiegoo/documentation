## First Setup

Intro
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the following steps:

- Install the ReachView 3 App
- Connect and place the GNSS antenna
- Power Reach
- Connect to Reach
- Perform firmware update
To do that, you will need Reach itself, an external GNSS antenna, a Wi-Fi network with Internet access and a smartphone.

- install ReachView 3
To manage Reach, we recommend using ReachView 3. Get it from the App Store or Google Play before updating.

There should be no obstacles near the antenna that could block the sky view higher than 30 degrees above the horizon. Do not test the device indoors or near buildings. Do not cover the skyview for the antennas with laptops, cars or yourself. RTK requires good satellite visibility and reception.

To learn how to properly place the antenna, check the Antenna placement guide.
