## What you'll need {#what_you_need}

Here are a few tools you'll need to do the activities in this course:

* **Computer.** You need a computer (if attending the live workshop, a laptop and charging cord), as there are many activities to work through.
* **Text editor**. If you don't already have a favorite text editor, download [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), as it works well on both Mac and Windows and is free. If you have another text editor you prefer (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or even [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), that will work too. Just make sure you can write code in plain text.
* **Chrome browser**. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) provides a Javascript Console that works well for inspecting JSON, so we'll be using Chrome. Also, in order to read JSON responses more easily in the browser, install the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) Chrome extension.
* **Postman**. [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) is an app that allows you to make requests and see responses through a visual client. *Make sure you download the app and not the Chrome extension.*
* **curl**. [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) is essential for making requests to endpoints from the command line. Mac already has curl built-in, but it might not be available by default on Windows. (Some Windows 10 builds already have it in Powershell.) On Windows, open a Command Prompt and type `curl -V`. If it's not installed, go to [confusedbycode.com/curl](http://confusedbycode.com/curl) and install a version (usually "With Administrator Privileges (free), 64-bit"). Close and re-open your Command Prompt and try typing `curl -V` again.
* **Git**. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control tool developers often use to collaborate on code. For Windows, see [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) to set up Git and the Git BASH terminal emulator. For Mac, see [Downloading Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
* **GitHub account**. [GitHub](https://github.com) will be used for various activities, sometimes to demonstrate the Git workflow and other times as an authentication service for developer tools. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for one.
* **Stoplight Studio Editor**. When working with the OpenAPI specification, we'll use the Stoplight Studio Editor. Stoplight Studio provides visual modeling tools for working with the OpenAPI specification. Stoplight offers both a web browser and standalone app versions of the editor. We'll be using the web browser version because it provides more complete functionality (such as trying out requests). Go to [https://stoplight.io/studio](https://stoplight.io/studio) and log in with GitHub.
* **OpenWeatherMap API key**. We’ll be using the OpenWeatherMap API for some exercises. It takes a couple of hours for the OpenWeatherMap API key to become active, so it's best if you get the API key ahead of time &mdash; then when you get to the OpenWeatherMap API activities, you’ll be all set. To get your (free) OpenWeatherMap API key, go to [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/). Click Sign Up in the top nav bar and create an account. After you sign up, OpenWeatherMap sends you an API key to your email. you can also find it when you log in and click the API Keys tab from the dashboard. Copy the key into a place you can easily find it.

## Testing Your Setup

In the past, people have asked for some tests to check whether their laptops are correctly set up.

* If you want to test whether Postman works, open up the Postman app and paste this into the GET box: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050&units=imperial&appid=126cac1a482f51de0f1287b45ae2bf9a`. Then click **Send**. If you get a response, it's working correctly. (In rare cases, sometimes people have security restrictions on their computers that block all network access.)
* If you want to test whether curl is installed, open Terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and paste in `curl --get "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050&units=imperial&appid=126cac1a482f51de0f1287b45ae2bf9a"`. If you get a JSON response, you're good.
* To check whether Git is installed, open up Terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and type `git --version`. If it's installed, you'll see the version.

## Video recordings

For video recordings of this course, see the [Video recordings of API doc workshops](idrather_docapis_course_videos.html). The page lists the most recent video recordings available. The video doesn't go into the same level of detail as the written material, but it would be a good start.


## Course slides

For the live workshops, I have various slides that cover different sections of this course. See [Course Slides](idrather_workshop.html) for the links. The slides use [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), which is an HTML/CSS/JS framework for slides. The images are single-sourced between the site and the slides, so they'll more likely stay in sync.

## Working with YAML

YAML is easier to work with because it removes the brackets, curly braces, and commas that get in the way of reading content.

<figure><a href="http://yaml.org/" class="noExtIcon"><img src="{{site.media}}/yamlscreenshot.png" alt="YAML" /></a><figcaption>The YAML site itself is written using YAML, which you can immediately see is not intended for coding web pages.</figcaption></figure>

YAML is an attempt to create a more human-readable data exchange format. It's similar to JSON (which is actually a subset of YAML) but uses spaces, colons, and hyphens to indicate the structure.

Many computers ingest data in a YAML or JSON format. It's a syntax commonly used in configuration files and an increasing number of platforms (like Jekyll), so it's a good idea to become familiar with it.



## YAML is a superset of JSON

For the most part, YAML and JSON are different ways of structuring the same data. Dot notation accesses the values the same way. For example, the Swagger UI can read the `openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml` files equivalently. Pretty much any parser that reads JSON will also read YAML. However, some JSON parsers might not read YAML because there are a few features YAML has that JSON lacks (more on that [below](#yaml_specific_features)).

## YAML syntax

With a YAML file, spacing is significant. Each two-space indent represents a new level:

```yaml
level1:
  level2:
    level3:
```

Each new level is an object. In this example, the `level1` object contains the `level2` object, which contains the `level3` object.

{: .note}
With YAML, you generally don't use tabs (since tab spacing is non-standard). Instead, you space twice.

Each level can contain either a single key-value pair (also referred to as a *dictionary* in YAML lingo) or a *sequence* (a list of hyphens):

```yaml
level3:
  -
    itema: "one"
    itemameta: "two"
  -
    itemb: "three"
    itembmeta: "four"
```

The values for each key can optionally be enclosed in quotation marks. If your value has a colon or quotation mark in it, enclose it in quotation marks.


## Comparing JSON to YAML

Earlier in the course, we looked at various [JSON structures involving objects and arrays](docapis_analyze_json.html). So let's look at the equivalent YAML syntax for each of these same JSON objects.

{: .tip}
You can use [Unserialize.me](http://www.unserialize.me/) to make the conversion from JSON to YAML or YAML to JSON.

Here are some key-value pairs in JSON:

```json
{
"key1":"value1",
"key2":"value2"
}
```

Here's the same structure expressed in YAML syntax:

```yaml
key1: value1
key2: value2
```

Here's an array (list of items) in JSON:

```json
["first", "second", "third"]
```

In YAML, the array is formatted as a list with hyphens:

```yaml
- first
- second
- third
```

Here's an object containing an array in JSON:

```json
{
"children": ["Avery","Callie","lucy","Molly"],
"hobbies": ["swimming","biking","drawing","horseplaying"]
}
```

Here's the same object with an array in YAML:

```yaml
children:
  - Avery
  - Callie
  - lucy
  - Molly
hobbies:
  - swimming
  - biking
  - drawing
  - horseplaying
```


Here's an array containing objects in JSON:

```json
[
   {
      "name":"Tom",
      "age":43
   },
   {
      "name":"Shannon",
      "age":41
   }
]
```

Here's the same array containing objects converted to YAML:

```yaml
-
  name: Tom
  age: 42
-
  name: Shannon
  age: 41
```

Hopefully, by seeing the syntax side by side, it will begin to make more sense. Is the YAML syntax more readable? It might be difficult to see in these simple examples, but generally it is.


JavaScript uses the same dot notation techniques to access the values in YAML as it does in JSON. (They're pretty much interchangeable formats.) The benefit to using YAML, however, is that it's more readable than JSON.


However, YAML might be more tricky because it depends on getting the spacing just right. Sometimes that spacing is hard to see (especially with a complex structure), and that's where JSON (while maybe more cumbersome) is perhaps easier to troubleshoot.

## Some features of YAML not present in JSON {#yaml_specific_features}

YAML has some features that JSON lacks. You can add comments in YAML files using the `#` sign. YAML also allows you to use something called "anchors." For example, suppose you have two definitions that are similar. You could write the definition once and use a pointer to refer to both:

```yaml
api: &apidef Application programming interface
application_programming_interface: *apidef
```

If you access the value, the same definition will be used for both. The `*apidef` acts as an anchor or pointer to the definition established at `&apidef`.

You won't use these unique YAML features in the OpenAPI tutorial, but they're worth noting because JSON and YAML aren't entirely equivalent. For details on other differences between JSON and YAML, see [Learn YAML in Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/). To learn more about YAML, see this [YAML tutorial](http://rhnh.net/2011/01/31/yaml-tutorial).

YAML is also used with [Jekyll](pubapis_jekyll.html). See my [YAML tutorial in the context of Jekyll](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_yaml_tutorial) for more details.

## JSON versus YAML for the spec format

Let's clear up some additional descriptors around JSON and YAML as well. The specification document in my OpenAPI tutorial uses YAML (which I introduced briefly [here](pubapis_yaml.html)), but it could also be expressed in JSON. JSON is a subset of YAML, so the two are practically interchangeable formats (for the data structures we're using). Ultimately, though, the OpenAPI spec is a JSON object. The specification notes:

>An OpenAPI document that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification is itself a JSON object, which may be represented either in JSON or YAML format. (See [Format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.1.0.md#format))

In other words, the OpenAPI document you create is a JSON object, but you have the option of expressing the JSON using either JSON or YAML syntax. YAML is more readable and is a more common format (see API Handyman's take on [JSON vs YAML](https://apihandyman.io/writing-openapi-swagger-specification-tutorial-part-1-introduction/#json-vs-yaml) for more discussion), so I've used YAML exclusively in code samples here. You will see that the OpenAPI specification documentation on GitHub always shows both the JSON and YAML syntax when showing specification formats. (For a more detailed comparison of YAML versus JSON, see "Relation to JSON" in the [YAML spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).)

YAML refers to data structures with three main terms: "mappings (hashes/dictionaries), sequences (arrays/lists) and scalars (strings/numbers)" (see "Introduction" in [YAML 1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)). However, because the OpenAPI spec is a JSON object, it uses JSON terminology &mdash; such as "objects," "arrays," "properties," "fields," and so forth. As such, I'll be showing YAML-formatted content but describing it using JSON terminology.

## Review and summary

So that we're on the same page with terms in the upcoming tutorial, let's briefly review. Each level in YAML (defined by a two-space indent) is an object. In the following code, `california` is an object. `animal`, `flower`, and `bird` are properties of the `california` object.

```yaml
california:
  animal: Grizzly Bear
  flower: Poppy
  bird: Quail
```

Here's what this looks like in JSON:

```json
{
  "california": {
    "animal": "Grizzly Bear",
    "flower": "Poppy",
    "bird": "Quail"
  }
}
```

The specification often uses the term "field" in the titles and table column names when listing the properties for a specific object. (Further, it identifies two types of fields &mdash; "fixed" fields are declared, unique names while "patterned" fields are regex expressions.) *Fields* and *properties* are used synonymously in the OpenAPI spec.

In the following code, `countries` contains an object called `united_states`, which contains an object called `california`, which contains several properties with string values:

```yaml
countries:
  united_states:
    california:
      animal: Grizzly Bear
      flower: Poppy
      bird: Quail
```

In the following code, `demographics` is an object that contains an array:

```yaml
demographics:
 - population
 - land
 - rivers
```

Here's what the above code looks like in JSON:

```json
{
  "demographics": [
    "population",
    "land",
    "rivers"
  ]
}
```

Hopefully, those brief examples will help align us with the terminology used in the tutorial.
