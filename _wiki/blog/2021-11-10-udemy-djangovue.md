**ref** see other file [mydoc_djangovue](/mydoc_djangovue.html)

### getting development environment
- vscode, python, visualstudio intellicode preview, **editor.rulers 79**.
- webapi objective, api definition
- First to use non-standard python packages, we will create venv with cli `python3 -m venv venv` and then source the env by `source venv/bin or /Scripts/activate`, which will display (venv) to the shell prompt. To check successful setup, run `pip list` and check the packages.
- how to handle requirements.txt; `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the packages.


#### regarding python version issue
- I have posted this issue at the forum;

Hi drf gurus;

This is to say hello to everyone here. Thanks for keeping me a company on this learning journey.


My question is whether the python version can be an issue. I think I must have updated it so my version at the vscode status bar says 3.8.10 64bit. Is it going to be a problem? Do I need to update requirements.txt or package.json because of this?

I find that using Django with linux is comparatively more reliable, from the ballpark guess off my head. It's not a proven fact. What do you think? My laptop runs on Windows 10, while this pc at home is Ubuntu 20.x.


I remember using Django (cookiecutter or something) with Visual Studio, which was a nice experience. Just sharing.


Happy coding, especially if you are new here like me. Let's divide and conquer.
