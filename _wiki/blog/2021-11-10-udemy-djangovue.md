{{site.data.alerts.note}}
Hi drf gurus;

This is to say hello to everyone here. Thanks for keeping me a company on this learning journey.


My question is whether the python version can be an issue. I think I must have updated it so my version at the vscode status bar says 3.8.10 64bit. Is it going to be a problem? Do I need to update requirements.txt or package.json because of this?

I find that using Django with linux is comparatively more reliable, from the ballpark guess off my head. It's not a proven fact. What do you think? My laptop runs on Windows 10, while this pc at home is Ubuntu 20.x.


I remember using Django (cookiecutter or something) with Visual Studio, which was a nice experience. Just sharing.


Happy coding, especially if you are new here like me. Let's go.
