## algo engine basics
Here are some examples of the ways the engine compares records.

- Is there a typo? If yes, how many?
- Does the query match on the first letter? Does it match the whole word? Or only partially?
- Does the word match a synonym?
- Does the query match the title of a record or its description?
- Is this item more popular than another item?
- When you add up the answers to these questions, some records have a stronger or weaker relevance. This is what determines the order of the results.

You can break down how to implement Algolia into three steps:

- Indexing your data into Algolia
- Configuring relevance and ranking settings
- Building a search user interface
