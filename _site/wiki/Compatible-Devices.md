## Minimum requirements
* There is one **must** requirement that is Android 4.0 or up. 
* You also need to have the Google Play Services library installed (it's already installed in most android devices). A good way to check this is by seeing if you can run the [Google maps app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps).
* You will need USB host also if you want to use a 3DR telemetry module directly, without USB you still can use a Bluetooth or TCP/UDP connection. 
* The 3DR OTG cable supplied with the 3DR telemetry module is asymmetric: ensure the blue end is plugged into the Android device.
* I use a 7 inch tablet for development, so I would suggest you get one that is at least this size.
